We are ready to start the demonstration.
Proceed.
A Corellian Corvette has been modified to house an
experimental cloaking device.
This test will confirm our ability to cloak a small
starship or freighter with a much lower power
consumption than ever before.
Ultimately, we hope to adapt this mechanism for use
on an Imperial starfighter.
Scientists evacuate the Research Facility.
Very impressive.
How close are you to perfecting this device?
Unfortunately, some technical problems remain.
There is a mysterious and possibly catastrophic
instability that is caused by using this device
in conjunction with hyperdrive engines.
Hmm...interesting....
Keep me informed on your progress.
I may have a use for this device very soon.
All is prepared at Endor for the upcoming battle.
I have ensured that the Rebels are unaware of the
true operational status of the new Death Star.
Even now, the Rebels are gathering their
forces at Sullust for their strike on Endor.
Little do they know of the the fate that awaits them.
Excellent, it is time for me to travel to Endor to
oversee the final destruction of their pitiful Rebellion.
All is as I have forseen.
Victory will be ours.
This is Admiral Zaarin.
You must activate the cloaking device at once!
Admiral Zaarin, the device is very unstable.
I don't know the consequences of using it in hyperspace.
We have no choice!
Start the initiation procedures immediately!
Yes, sir!
Once again, we have evaded Thrawn's grasp.
I knew I would be able to beat that...
Ohhhhh!!!
Thus is the fate of enemies of the Empire.
Here at Endor, all preparations are
ready for the Rebel attack.
Soon, they will realize the full
futility of resisting my will.
Grand Admiral Thrawn, you must bring your hunt
for the renegade Zaarin to its final conclusion.
Do not fail me now.
Yes, Emperor Palpatine.
I have studied Zaarin's ways closely.
He will not resist the bait that
I have laid out for him.
Soon, he too will meet his end.
Excellent, once Zaarin and the Rebels are
destroyed, our victory will be complete.
You are now the Emperor's Eyes.
You are now the Emperor's Voice.
You are now the Emperor's Reach.
You are now the Emperor's Envoy.
You are now the Emperor's Sentinal.
You are now the Emperor's Guardian.
