Star Destroyers on approach to Coruscant,
the Imperial Seat of the galaxy!
The Emperor has summoned his fleets to
unveil the future of the Empire!
TIE fighters escort shuttles to Coruscant City
where the Emperor is about to speak.
The Empire is on the verge of success.
Soon, Peace and Order will be restored
throughout the galaxy.
Even now, our capable forces, led by Darth Vader,
are striking back at the Rebel insurgents.
Imperial Armada under the command of Darth Vader.
Outer Rim Sector near a Rebel Base.
The Rebels are unprepared for our attack.
Signal Vice Admiral Thrawn to launch his
TIE Squadrons immediately!
This Rebel stronghold has no hope of escape.
Commence the attack!
Yes Sir!
You have been transferred to a new sector.

Welcome to the inner circle.
You are now the Emperor's Hand.
You are being taken to a secluded prison planet!
Prisoners!  Move into the building now!
A shuttle carries Admiral Harkov to
a secret rendezvous with the Rebellion.
I have come with an offer for the Rebellion.
We have little reason to trust you Admiral Harkov,
but we are willing to hear your offer.
The fleet under my command is willing to
join the Rebel Alliance, for a price.
Very interesting Admiral, we have great need for
officers of your caliber.  Here is what I propose...
Select representatives are brought from two warring
worlds to hear a message of peace from the Empire.
The civil war that has ravaged your planets is over.
It is time to lay down your arms.
Join us, to rebuild all that was
destroyed in this savage conflict.
Even now, the process of repairing
your planets has begun.
The fleet led by Vice Admiral Thrawn oversees
repairs on a platform damaged by the Rebellion.
How are the repairs proceeding?
The damage caused by the
Rebel attack is repaired.
Excellent.  I want this installation
fully operational within the hour.
Yes sir!  We will be prepared for
any further Rebel attack.
Welcome Lord Vader.
Let us show you the improvements
we've made to the TIE Advanced.
The Emperor is very interested in
your progress, Admiral Zaarin.
Hyperspace capability.  Impressive.
The first TIE Advanced are now seeing
combat.  We also have prototypes of
the next generation of TIE fighters.
Interesting.  The Emperor will
want a prototype immediately.
Welcome Admiral Harkov, we have a matter to discuss.
What is the location of your fleet?
Now, you shall pay for your treachery.
Is the beam weapon completed?
Yes Admiral Zaarin, we are
ready to deploy the weapon.
Excellent!  Begin arming my
fighter squadrons at once.
Yes Sir!
The palace of the Emperor at Coruscant City.
We are here to honor one who has served the Empire.
Yes, ..Lord Vader
My Master, I have tracked Admiral Harkov
to a Rebel space installation.
I want Admiral Harkov captured alive.  We must
apprehend all the traitors under his command.
I will see to it personally.
Do not fail me, Vader.  Harkov's fleet must not escape.
We have finished our analysis of Admiral Zaarin's new
TIE fighter.  It outperforms the new TIE Advanced.
Excellent, the Admiral is fortunate it did not fall
into Rebel hands.  Why was security so careless?
Admiral Zaarin suspects a Rebel spy has infiltrated
his research facility.  He is investigating the matter.
He reports that the Rebels
have a new weapon technology.
Keep me informed.  The Rebels
must not gain any advantage.
I am close to capturing Admiral Harkov's fleet.
Excellent Lord Vader, Harkov's fleet
must not fall in Rebel hands.
Be on guard, the Secret Order
has alerted me of danger.
I will keep you informed of my progress.
Rely on the members of the Secret Order to carry
out your mission, they have proved most valuable.
