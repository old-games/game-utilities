// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   We have set up this mission as
a test of your dogfighting
abilities.  The Frigate Challenge will
launch waves of starfighters
against you.  Your job is to
defeat as many of the waves as
possible.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly an [Assault Gunboat]
designated [Tau 1].  You are the
only ship in your flight group.
Your craft will be armed with 16
concussion missiles.  Use them
wisely.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   The mission starts easily with a
single starfighter to face, then
progresses through more
challenging adversaries with each
new wave of starfighters.  You will
face each fighter in the entire
Rebel arsenal.

What have I accomplished?
   You have shown that you can
defeat any craft that the Rebels
can throw at you.  This should
give you confidence for the
battles ahead.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   First off, stay away from the
Frigate, its laser batteries are
deadly.  Second, save your
concussion missiles for use against
the hardest foes, the A-wings.
Third, when fighting against multiple
craft watch your [TIA] lights in
your HUD to see when they are
beginning their firing runs.  ÿ
