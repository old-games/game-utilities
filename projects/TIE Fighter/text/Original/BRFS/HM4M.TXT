// QUESTIONS: 
What are the mission objectives?
   The objective is to completely
destroy all of the [TIE Defenders]
located at this base.  Most are
stationary at the outset of the
mission, but work quickly before
they get manned.  The tractor
beam has been radically improved.
With the high speeds and quick
turns that the [TIE Defender] can
achieve, the new and improved beam
weapon will be very useful.
Directing the tractor beam weapon
at a TIE Defender will defeat its
ability to maneuver away from you.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will be the flight leader,
[Missile Boat Tau 1].  You will have
one wingman.  Your craft will be
armed with [40] advanced missiles
and [30] advanced torpedoes.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   You will be attacking a squadron
of enemy [TIE Defenders].  They will
be your only threat.

What did we accomplish?
   You proved that the [missile
boat] can go up against a superior
number of [TIE Defenders] and be
victorious.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   Fire [6] torpedoes at container
transport [Thor] at the start of
the mission, then destroy any
shuttles launched using dual
torpedoes.  This will stop the
pilots from getting to the [8]
parked [TIE Defenders].  Use the
beam weapon and dual missiles on
TIE Defender group [Rover].  Once
the TIE Defender group [Rover] is
destroyed, then go after the
parked [TIE Defenders].  ÿ
