// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   The objective here is to
destroy all of the mines that are
protecting the space containers.
This requires frequent maneuvering
and pinpoint laser firing accuracy.
Use quad fire for a bigger hit
pattern.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly a [TIE Interceptor]
designated [Alpha 1].  In this mission
you will be without wingmen.  Your
craft will have [no] warheads.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   No Rebel spacecraft have been
seen in this sector.  The mines are
the only form of defense for the
containers.

// SKIP
What have I accomplished?
   You have learned to use the
speed and maneuverability of the
TIE Interceptor to weave through
a dangerous situation and destroy
a minefield.  You show great
promise.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Since your craft has no
shields, you must not spend too
long on lining your target before
firing.  Practice quickly swinging
the target into your sights and
shooting.  Fire a single linked burst
or two single bursts before
turning to avoid the mine's fire.  ÿ
