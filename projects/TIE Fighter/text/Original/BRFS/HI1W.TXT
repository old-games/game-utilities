// MISSION: 
>TIE Interceptor Combat #1: Threat Display
// NEXT
This mission designed for Peregrine Software, Inc. by >David Wessman  1994c
// NEXT
You will use short range sensors to [inspect] a variety of craft at a Customs Checkpoint.
// NEXT
For the sensors to be effective, you must fly your craft as close as 100 meters  ([0.10] in the CMD.)
// NEXT
Throughout you will be instructed in the use of your [Threat Display] and [Inflight Map].
// NEXT
You will receive further instructions in flight.  Follow your orders precisely.  Enter the simulation now.

// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   This mission will teach you the
use of your short range sensors,
threat display and inflight map.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly [TIE Interceptor
Gamma 1] (T/I Gamma 1.) It is a
faster and more powerful
development of the basic TIE
Fighter.  Armament consists of
four wingtip-mounted lasers.  Like
its predecessor it does not have
shields.  Speed and maneuverablity
are its chief means of defense.
// NEXT
What oppostion will there be?
   There will be no opposition at
first.  You are merely inspecting
neutral vessels at a customs
checkpoint.  If you elect to
continue the mission you will
discover an illicit cargo.  You will
then face [Lambda-class shuttles]
operated by smugglers.  Still later,
you must defend against a raid by
a small Rebel force.

What have I accomplished?
   You have demonstrated the
ability to inspect unknown craft to
determine the contents of their
cargo bays.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   The range at which your short
range sensors are effective is
related to the size of the
targeted craft.  The smaller the
target, the closer you must be.
Generally, the nearest you'll have
to get is 0.1 kilometers.  When
making a "flyby" inspection aim for
the rear of the target craft to
minimize your risk of collision.  ÿ
