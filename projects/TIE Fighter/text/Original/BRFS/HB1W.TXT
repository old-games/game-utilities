// MISSION: 
>TIE Bomber Combat #1: Proton Torpedoes
// NEXT
This mission designed for Peregrine Software, Inc. by >David Wessman  1994c
// NEXT
You will learn how to target and destroy enemy craft using [proton torpedoes].
// NEXT
Your first targets will be two stationary containers followed by a moving freighter.
// NEXT
If you wish, you may then engage a hostile corvette but watch your distance!  It can kill at [two] kms.
// NEXT
When you run out of torpedoes, [TRN Omicron] will be launched from the Training Platform.
// NEXT
To receive a reload, target it and press [Shift-B]. Rendezvous with the TRN and come to a full stop.
// NEXT
[Omicron] will dock with you and your warhead launchers will be replenished.  This will take [5] seconds.
// NEXT
[Omicron] will remain "on call" to replenish your warheads as you need them. 
// NEXT
When you're ready for another reload, use [Shift-B] again.  You can get [20] reloads this way.
// NEXT
You will receive further instructions in flight.  Follow your instructor's commands to the letter!
// NEXT
If you like, you may continue to practice against even tougher targets.

// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   To practice [proton torpedo]
attacks.  You will learn how to
acquire and hold a lock for the
torpedo's homing system before
firing.  When targeting large ships
you may target individual
components of the hull, engines,
etc.  You may even "surgically"
remove the enemy ships armament
by targeting the individual lasers!
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly [TIE Bomber Beta 1]
(T/B Beta 1).  It is a special heavy
version of the basic TIE
starfighter.  Armament consists of
twin warhead launchers and two
wing panel mounted lasers.  It is
slower and less maneuverable than
the TIE Fighter but has a much
stronger hull.
   For this mission your craft is
armed with the standard load of [6
proton torpedoes].  Proton
torpedoes are self-propelled
warheads with a tracking and
homing system.  You may acquire a
lock as far as [six] kilometers away
from your target.  This allows you
to stay well outside the range of
enemy guns.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   There will be no opposition at
first.  If you like, you may
continue the combat to practice
against targets that will shoot
back.
   When you run out of torpedoes
you will want to get reloaded.
Transport Omicron will leave the
hangar when you have launched all
of your torpedoes.  You may
request that the Transport
"board" you to resupply your
warhead load.
   To request a reload, target
the Transport and press [Shift-B].
Your throttle will be set to zero
so the Transport can dock with
you.

What have I accomplished?
   You have shown the ability to
track and acquire a target lock
for launching proton torpedoes.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Keep the targeted craft inside
your targeting box.  To do this
you might try placing the center
pip of your HUD over the target
and keeping it there until the
targeting box turns red.  ÿ
