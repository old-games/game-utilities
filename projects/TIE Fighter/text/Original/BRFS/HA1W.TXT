// MISSION: 
>TIE Advanced Combat #1: Concussion Missiles
// NEXT
This mission designed for Peregrine Software, Inc. by >David Wessman  1994c
// NEXT
You will use your targeting system to track enemy craft and destroy them with [concussion missiles].
// NEXT
You will begin with a single, stationary X-wing with no deflector shields.
// NEXT
Each new X-wing that enters will fly faster and more evasively than the one before.
// NEXT
Your primary objective is to destroy the first [7] X-wings that enter.
// NEXT
If you wish, you may pursue a secondary objective of defeating [5] hostile X-wings in combat.
// NEXT
They will enter individually and with full shields.  They will increase in aggressiveness and intelligence.
// NEXT
If you run out of missiles you have [1] reload available.  Target [TUG C.M. Cadiy] and press [Shift-B].
// NEXT
Rendezvous with the tug and come to a complete halt.  Reloading will take [5] seconds.

// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   To practice [concussion missile]
attacks.  You will learn how to
acquire and hold a lock for the
missile's homing system before
firing.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly [TIE Advanced Alpha
1] (T/A Alpha 1).  It is the Imperial
Navy's latest operational
starfighter.  Armament consists of
twin warhead launchers and quad
wingtip mounted lasers.  It is
faster and more maneuverable than
any other fighter currently in
service.  It is the first TIE
starfighter to be equipped with
hyperdrive capability and deflector
shields.
   For this mission your craft is
armed with the standard load of [8
concussion missiles].  Concussion
missiles are self-propelled warheads
equipped with homing devices.  Your
targeting computer and sensors
"fix" the warhead's homing system
on the target.  This allows you
(once you have a "lock") to "fire
and forget" about the weapon.  It
will track the target on its own
and you can proceed to engage
other targets.  You should be
aware that the missiles can acquire
small targets as far as [2.5
kilometers] away.  Generally, the
optimal range is between 1 and 2
kilometers.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   First you will engage [X-wing]
starfighters.  This is the Rebel's
premiere frontline tactical fighter.
It has only one advantage over
the TIE Advanced and that is a
slightly stronger hull.
   Later, if you wish, you may
engage [A-wings].  This Rebel fighter
most closely matches the
performance of the Advanced.  Its
two advantages are more missiles
(12) and better acceleration.

What have I accomplished?
   You have demonstrated the
ability to use missiles in combat
against other starfighters!
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Keep the targeted craft inside
your targeting box.  To do this
you might try placing the center
pip of your HUD over the target
and keeping it there until the
targeting box turns red.  ÿ
