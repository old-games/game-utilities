// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   The mission objective is to
capture a Rebel Escort Carrier.
Follow your leader as he picks one
of the escort carriers to attack.
Drop both bombs on your first
pass.  Then switch to [ion cannons]
and disable that carrier.  You only
have time to disable one of the
carriers but try and inspect both
of their cargoes.  Attack and
destroy any other Rebel craft
that may arrive to help the
escort carrier.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly the [TIE Defender],
designated [Alpha 2].  You will be the
wingman of a 2 ship attack group.
Your craft will be armed with [2]
heavy space bombs.  A transport
can be called in as part of the
reinforcements to reload your ship
with more bombs.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   The Escort Carriers appear to
have no escort themselves,
however, their fierce laser
batteries are quite capable of
putting up a powerful defense.
The Rebels are likely to send
backup forces when their carriers
come under attack.

What have I accomplished?
   You have played a key role in
capturing the Rebel escort carrier
along with its complement of
starfighters.  This operation was a
major success.  Good work.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Once you have dropped your
bombs in the attack run get out
of their path so when the escort
carrier starts firing its laser
batteries at you they won't hit
your bombs.  Also, keep you laser
recharge level on maximum so you
can shift energy from your lasers
to your shields whenever
necessary.  ÿ
