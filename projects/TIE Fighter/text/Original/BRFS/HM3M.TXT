// QUESTIONS: 
What are the mission objectives?
   Your objective is to help
rescue the corvette group [Dagger].
Your part in this mission includes
destroying all the [mines] around the
corvettes, then providing
starfighter cover for the
corvettes and the repair craft
until all three craft can hyperjump
to safety.  You will have to
intercept and eliminate any enemy
craft in the area.  Remember, the
repair craft will not enter the
area until all the mines have been
destroyed.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will be the flight leader,
[Missile Boat Tau 1].  You will have
one wingman.  Your craft will be
armed with [40] advanced missiles
plus [10] space bombs.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   You will be encountering [Type B]
mines.  These type of mines are
armed with ION cannons instead of
laser cannons.  They are used to
disable pre-programmed targets, so
the disabled craft can be
captured or looted.  ION bolts
move slower than laser blasts so
they can be avoided easier if you
jink.  It is likely that those who
laid this minefield trap will return
to see if they have snared
anyone.  Pay attention to your
inflight messages because they will
alert you to important mission
developments.

What did we accomplish?
   We saved the Imperial corvette
group [Dagger].  We also defeated
many Rebel craft.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   Start destroying [mines] using
your laser cannon, you have one
minute before a Rebel cruiser
enters the area and starts
launching starfighters.  If the
cruiser enters before you are
done destroying the mines, forget
about the mines until the enemy
starfighters are all destroyed.
Primary craft to intercept are the
[Y-wings], [B-wings] and [X-wings].  They
target the corvettes and carry
torpedoes.  When firing from close
range use your missiles like
unguided rockets by firing without
waiting for a complete red target
lock.  ÿ
