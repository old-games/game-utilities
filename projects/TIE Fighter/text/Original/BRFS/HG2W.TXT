// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   To work as part of a team to
recover stolen Imperial munitions.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly the [Assault Gunboat]
designated [Mu 2] of a four ship
flight group.  For this mission your
ship will be fitted with a standard
load of [16] concussion missiles.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   The pirates have a pair of
armed [cargo ferries] with three
[escort shuttles] for protection.
The Rebels also have a pair of
armed [cargo ferries], but their
escorts are [Y-wings].  Later in the
mission you will face pairs of
[X-wings, A-wings and B-wings].

What have I accomplished?
   You have recovered Imperial
property while teaching our enemies
a lesson!
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Use the "assign current target
to wingman" order to take out the
enemy craft as quickly as possible.
Start with the [escort shuttles]
first.  You might try ordering your
wingmen to attack one target,
while you take another for
yourself.  Just remember to keep
assigning new targets for your
wingmen.
   If mission critical craft are
escaping, target them early in the
mission and use the Threat Display.
See how long it will take them to
reach their hyperspace points and
plan accordingly.  ÿ
