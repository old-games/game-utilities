// NEXT
This mission designed for Peregrine Software by >David Wessman  1994c
// NEXT
You will begin surrounded by [four class E cargo containers] designated with Rebel starfighter names.
// NEXT
To initiate a dogfight of escalating difficulty with a particular craft, [inspect] its namesake container.
// NEXT
To initiate all five skill levels at once, [attack] (but do NOT destroy) the particular craft's namesake CN/E.
// NEXT
You will face pilots flying at each of five pilot skill levels: [Novice, Officer, Veteran, Ace] and [Top Ace].
// NEXT
Your primary objective is to destroy at least one of each craft at the [Novice] pilot level.  Only [4] kills!
// NEXT
The optional secondary goal is to destroy at least one of each craft at each skill level ([16] more kills!)
// NEXT
Combat utility vehicle [Reload] will reload your warheads when your launchers are empty (press [Shift-B].)
// NEXT
This will automatically shut off your engines to allow the CUV to board you, so try to be close to it.
// NEXT
It will follow you unless ordered to wait between reloads ([Shift-W], then [Shift-G] to resume docking.)
// NEXT
For additional bonus points [inspect] (or [attack]) CN/E [Challenge] to face ENEMY TIE Defenders.

// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   To further develop your
dogfighting abilities.  Energy
management will be a bit more
complex, but the Defender has
much more powerful energy
systems.  This will allow you to
maintain most systems at maximum
recharge and still retain a high
speed.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly the [TIE Defender
Delta 1] (T/D Delta 1.) This is the
Imperial Navy's newest starfighter.
Standard armament consists of
four laser and two ion cannons, as
well as a dual warhead launcher.
   It is also equipped with a
specialized tractor beam system
that can inhibit a target craft's
ability to maneuver.  Its deflector
shields are the new fast charging
type.  Add to all this hyperdrive
capability, high maneuverablity, the
quickest acceleration and fastest
sublight speed yet achieved, and
you have the most powerful
starighter in the galaxy!
   For this mission your ship will be
equipped with the standard load of
[8] advanced concussion missiles.
The [advanced concussion missile] is
faster, tracks better and has a
more powerful warhead than its
predecessor.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   You will be able to select any
of the four principal starfighters
used by the Rebel Alliance.  These
include the Y-wing, X-wing, A-wing
and B-wing.  You may also choose
to engage hostile TIE Defenders!
   Arrival of a particular craft
type is triggered by inspecting or
attacking its namesake container.
Each craft has nine replacement
waves at each of the five pilot
skill levels.
   The order of entry is
determined by craft destruction.
The destruction of the first
[Novice] enemy will trigger a [Novice]
replacement and cause the arrival
of the first [Officer] craft.  The
replacement of the first [Officer]
destoyed will be joined by the
first [Veteran] and so on.
   [ALL] craft will respond to
inflight orders for waiting,
proceeding with the mission and
going home.  You may thereby tailor
a mission to your liking by giving
the appropriate commands to the
various craft

What have I accomplished?
   You have demonstrated the
ability to dogfight with the best
the Rebels have to offer!  Use
this mission to challenge yourself
to your utmost.  Try attacking all
of the containers as quickly as
you can from the start.  This will
put you in the midst of 25 enemy
craft.
   Note that they will not all
attack simultaneously, they would
get in each others way if they
did, but you will always be under
attack from somebody.  The TIE
Defenders may even become
engaged in dogfights with Rebel
fighters.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   If you're getting overwhelmed,
don't forget to use the inflight
orders to make some of the enemy
craft "wait" or "go home." To send
all current and replacement craft
of a particular type home at once,
[destroy] the namesake container.  ÿ
