// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   To capture the leadership of
both sides in the Sepan Civil War.
They will be vulnerable to capture
during a deep space rendezvous
near [Sepan 8].  Their shuttle craft
are to be disabled, then boarded
by Stormtrooper Transports.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly the [Assault Gunboat]
designated [Nu 2] of a four craft
flight group.  For this mission your
craft has been loaded with the
standard warhead armament of [16]
concussion missiles.
   You will be teamed with [TRN
Omega 1], while [GUN Tau] is teamed
with [TRN Omega 2].  Get in fast and
disable the leaders' shuttles.  Once
disabled, they will be boarded by
stormtroopers and the leaders
captured.  You will protect the
boarding operation by destroying
any craft which try to interfere.
Once the leaders have been
captured you will all hyperspace
out to a rendezvous with the
[Protector].
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   The [Dimok's] flagship, a modified
Nebulon-B2 class frigate ([M/FRG
Manus Ferre]) will be nearby.  During
the battle it will deploy a full
squadron of [Z-95 Headhunters].
The [Ripoblus] will also have a
frigate present, a standard
Nebulon-B class ([FRG Shemsher]).
Several [Ripoblus Escort Shuttles]
will be on patrol.
   The enemy will try to prevent
the capture, they may even decide
to kill their own rather than let
them be taken.  Concentrate on
any craft which attack either of
our stormtrooper transports.

// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   Keep an eye out for any large
cargo carrying vessels.  Search
their cargo holds for any evidence
of captured or stolen Imperial
equipment.  The Emperor is
suspicious of how the Dimok and
Ripoblus are arming themselves.
Their industrial capacity is not
sufficient to explain the quantity
of weapons they have been
throwing into battle.  They must
have another source.

What did we accomplish?
   Our special operation was a
success, with minimal casualties.  As
it turns out, the individuals we
captured are not the [Dimok] and
[Ripoblus] leaders, but the children
of both sides' leaders.  Apparently,
they were to be used as hostages
in a cynical attempt by each side
to assure the others adherence
to a new treaty.
   This treaty calls for an
immediate suspension of hostilities
between them.  Furthermore, they
intend to join forces against us!
We had hoped to persuade them to
negotiate a peace settlement
under Imperial auspices.  This would
have been preferable to the
Imperial Navy imposing a settlement.
Now, it seems we have no choice...
   Sector HQ will not be happy
about this, but we are going to
need substantial reinforcements to
pacify the Sepan system.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Immediately after both leader's
shuttles are disabled, attack the
nearest Escort Shuttles.  Use as
many as [4] concussion missiles to
reduce its shields quickly, then
finish it with lasers.  Concentrate
on the E/Ss and try to remain
close to the Transports.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What did I accomplish?
   You have uncovered further
evidence that someone within the
Imperial Navy is selling arms to the
Dimok and Ripoblus.  We must
discover who this traitor is.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   During the intense firefight
with the enemy starfighters, keep
an eye out for any large cargo
carrying vessels.  Be sure to
inspect them.  ÿ
