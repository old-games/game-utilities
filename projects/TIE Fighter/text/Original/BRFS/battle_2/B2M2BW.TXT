// MISSION: 
>The Sepan Civil War, Mission #2: Intercept Attack
// NEXT
This mission designed for Peregrine Software, Inc. by >David Wessman  1994c
// NEXT
We are going to intercept a [Ripoblus] reprisal raid on a [Dimok] deep space research facility.
// NEXT
The raiding forces are made up of a pair of Modified Corellian Corvettes and several Assault Transports.
// NEXT
[T/B Beta] will deploy to destroy one of the corvettes as an example to the rest of them.
// NEXT
The loss should convince the [Ripoblus] to break off their attack.  If not, continue your assault.
// NEXT
We are not seeking complete destruction of the attackers.  We merely want to force a withdrawal.
// NEXT
The [Ripoblus] leadership must also be taught that further acts of aggression will be severely punished!

// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   The Sepan Civil War threatens
to break out in full fury.  The
Ripoblus are angered by the Dimoks'
previous raid on their supply
convoy.  They are seeking revenge
by attacking a Dimok space
installation.
   The Empire's goal is to prevent
this conflict from mushrooming and
spilling over into neighboring star
systems.  Therefore, Imperial
forces must stop either side from
gaining the advantage.
   To this end, you will help to
drive off the attacking [Ripoblus]
forces before they can do too
much damage to the [Dimok] space
station.  When they've taken
sufficient losses they will withdraw.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly TIE Bomber [Beta 2]
out of VSD [Protector].  Your flight
group consists of three craft.
For this mission your craft is
armed with the standard load of [8
proton torpedoes].
   A Combat Utility Vehicle is
available to provide reloads for
your warhead launchers whenever
they are empty.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   There are presently two
[Modified Corvettes] and four
[Assault Transports] attacking the
station.  The M/CRVs are not yet
in range, but the ATRs are within
torpedo range.
   The [Ripoblus] have a [Modified
Frigate] and more ATRs in reserve.
All of these craft are well armed
and dangerous from almost any
angle of approach.  Your best
tactic is to stay outside of
cannon range as much as possible.
   The [Dimok] station itself is well
armed and is defended by a
handful of [Z-95 Headhunters] and
a pair of [Escort Shuttles].

// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   The [Dimoks] claim this is a
scientific research station.
Naturally, we are concerned to
know what kind of research.  As
opportunity allows attempt to
inspect the platform and nearby
cargo containers.
   Anything out of the ordinary
may require further actions.  Be
prepared to receive new orders.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What did we accomplish?
   By intercepting a [Ripoblus]
attack on the [Dimoks] we
demonstrated that the Empire
favors neither side in this conflict.
Soon they will all learn to obey
Imperial rule.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Stay with your flight leader and
assist his attacks.  You will be
more effective fighting as a group.
Also, enemy gunners are more likely
to become confused when facing
multiple threats.  This ensures
that you won't have to take all of
the defensive fire by yourself!
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What have I accomplished?
   You discovered the existence
of a secret weapons lab and
played a role in its capture.
Congratulations, such initiative is
rare!
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Wait until the [Ripoblus] are on
the run before inspecting the
platform and containers.  Try to
have a full load of torpedoes
ready so you can take out the
Escort Shuttles as soon as they
turn on Imperial forces.  They will
concentrate their attacks on
Transport Epsilon.  ÿ
