// MISSION: 
>The Sepan Civil War, Mission #3: Rescue War Refugees
// NEXT
This mission designed for Peregrine Software, Inc. by >David Wessman  1994c
// NEXT
Some [Ripoblus] refugees of the civil war have hijacked System Patrol Craft [Glas] and are seeking asylum. 
// NEXT
The SPC has no hyperdrive, but is accompanied by a pair of [Lambda]-class shuttles providing escort.
// NEXT
Their own government is trying to stop them.  A team of [Y-wings] and [Shuttles] has just arrived!
// NEXT
[T/I Gamma] will intercept the Y-wings while [T/F Alpha] attacks the shuttles. Each group contains 3 craft.
// NEXT
[SPC Glas] must be kept safe long enough to dock with the [Protector] and transfer everyone aboard.
// NEXT
The [Glas] will then be fitted with decoys and abandoned.  Their shuttles will enter our hangar.

// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   To provide safe asylum to some
[Ripoblus] refugees fleeing from the
Sepan Civil War.  They are
principally scientists who are weary
of the way their knowledge has
been put to use.  They have
stolen a System Patrol Craft (SPC)
and a couple of Lambda-class
shuttles.  The SPC isn't hyperdrive
capable so it will have to dock with
the [Protector] to transfer the
refugees.  The shuttles can be
accomodated in our hangar.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly a [TIE Interceptor]
designated [Gamma 2].  Your flight
group will consist of the three
craft.  T/F Alpha will join you.  T/B
Beta will be in reserve.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   The [Ripoblus] government forces
consist of four [Y-wings] and four
[Lambda-class Shuttles].  We expect
that Y-wings will attempt to disable
the SPC and one of the Shuttles
will then try to board and capture
it.  The [Dimoks] will probably try
something as well, so stay alert.

What did we accomplish?
   We brought a peaceful end to
this war for at least some of the
people.  These refugees we've
rescued will be forever grateful to
the Empire and the Imperial Navy!
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Break up the Y-wing's attack
runs.  Pick one and fire at it until
it starts evading, then fire at
the next one.  Use the "assign
current target to wingman"
command to gang up on a single
ship.
   When the "nearest unknown"
turns out to be one of the
refugee's ships, press "A" to
target its attacker (if there is
one).  Gang your flight group up
on this target.  ÿ
