// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   To ensure that Admiral Harkov's
flagship, the [VSD Protector]
receives new [TIE Advanced] to
replace the TIE Fighters and
Interceptors we've lost during this
operation.  The [Escort Carrier
Tropsobor] is to rendezvous with
us shortly.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly a [TIE Fighter]
designated [Alpha 2].  You will
conduct defense of the
rendezvous area where the
Protector is scheduled to meet
[ESC Tropsobor].  Any hostile craft
which enter the area are to be
immediately attacked and destroyed.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   Both sides of the Sepan Civil
War have now determined that the
Empire is their common enemy.
Accordingly, they have decided to
put aside their differences and
join together to drive us out!
There is, of course, no possibility
of their succeeding.
   Unfortunately, they do have an
opportunity to do considerable
harm while this rendezvous takes
place.  Our probes have
intercepted a frenzy of
communications traffic that
indicate they are preparing a major
operation!
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   Do as your commander orders,
and, as always, keep an eye out
for anything unusual.  We believe
there may be another ship coming
to this rendezvous.  If so, we
want you to inspect it if you can.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What did we accomplish?
   You fulfilled your duties as
required.  The TIE Advanced will be
entered into service immediately.
It would appear that the attack
was a desperate last ditch
attempt to thwart Imperial
ambitions in this sector.  We
expect this sector to be much
more cooperative from now on!
   Since the TIE Advanced is
ready for front line service, it
would be wise of you to brush up
on your skills for this craft in the
Combat Chamber.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Follow the orders you receive
over the radio.  That is, take out
the Y-wings first, then help T/F
Delta with the Z-95s.  Protect the
TIE Bombers as much as you can.
They will be attacking with rockets,
(and doing a lot of damage) but
they're pretty vulnerable to the
Headhunters.
// NEXT

// SKIP
What did we accomplish?
   The evidence you have
gathered for us has been
incredibly important!  Shuttle
Omlaut's passenger was a member
of the Rebel Alliance.  The individual
was taken directly to [Admiral
Harkov] and they have been alone
ever since.  This is very alarming in
light of our investigation into the
chronic shortages of equipment
reported by Harkov.  It seems
clear he has be selling Imperial
weapons and supplies to whoever
has the credits...even the Rebel
traitors!
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Disregard the order to return
to the hangar immediately and
inspect Shuttle [Omlaut] instead.  ÿ
