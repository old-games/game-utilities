// MISSION: 
>The Sepan Civil War, Mission #1: Respond to S.O.S.
// NEXT
This mission designed for Peregrine Software, Inc. by >David Wessman  1994c
// NEXT
We have received a distress signal from a [Ripoblus] convoy under attack by [Dimok] marauders.  
// NEXT
The [Dimok] attackers are using a Modified Corellian Corvette and several Y-wings.
// NEXT
Six TIE Fighters will deploy in two groups ([T/F Alpha] and ([T/F Eta]) to attack the Y-wings.
// NEXT
Additionally, three TIE Bombers ([T/B Beta]) will deploy to engage the corvette.
// NEXT
The [Dimoks] are to be driven off, not annihilated, so be sure to let some of them escape.
// NEXT
Those that escape will report back to their leaders.  They will realize the Empire means to end this war.

// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   The [Sepan] peoples have been
torn apart by civil war for
generations.  Each of the rival
factions (the [Ripoblus] and the
[Dimoks]) is guilty of committing
atrocities against the other.
Admiral Harkov has been given the
task of bringing an end to this
civil war.
   Your objective is to save as
much of the [Ripoblus] convoy as
possible.  This will be accomplished
by destroying enough of the
attacking [Dimoks] to force the rest
to withdraw.  The survivors will
report back to their leaders.
Hopefully, their leaders will quickly
realize the futility of further
armed struggle.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly a [TIE Fighter]
designated [Alpha 2].  Your flight
group will consist of three craft.
Follow your flight leader during the
mission.  You will be accompanied by
the T/F Eta and T/B Beta.  T/B
Delta and T/I Gamma are standing
by should circumstances require
additional firepower.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   The [Dimoks] operate a number of
[Y-wings].  Their fleet of capital
ships is small, but includes a
variety of small to medium
starships.  Many are converted
merchantmen, but at least one is a
Mon Calamari light cruiser with a
squadron of [Z-95 Headhunters].
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   Do as your commander orders,
but pay attention to everything
around you.  Inspect the cargo
contents of the convoy if you
get the opportunity.
   Admiral Harkov's performance so
far has not been all the Emperor
had hoped for.  Conflicting reports
give us reason to believe
everything is not as it seems in
this civil war.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What have I accomplished?
   You have helped prevent the
destruction of the [Ripoblus]
convoy.  In doing so a strong and
clear signal to the [Dimok] leadership
that the Empire will not tolerate
any further aggressive actions
from them.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Stick with your flight leader
(T/F Alpha 1).  Use the Threat
Display to see what Alpha 1's
current target is and join in the
attack.
   Use your targeting computer's
memory presets to keep track of
the Ripoblus cargo ships.  You can
quickly find out if any are being
attacked by targeting them and
pressing the ['A'] key.  The nearest
attacking starfighter will now be
targeted.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What have I accomplished?
   You have uncovered some very
alarming evidence.  There is no
legitimate way the [Ripoblus] could
have acquired Imperial armaments.
Remain vigilant.  We will speak again.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Target the [modular conveyors]
at the start of the mission and
inspect them first.  Your flight
leader will keep the Dimoks busy.
When [TRN Epsilon] is launched,
target it and save it in your
target memory.  Use the ['A'] key to
quickly determine when it is under
attack, then intercept any
attackers.
   You may assist Epsilon by
reducing the shields of the modular
conveyors.  When the escort
shuttles arrive, be careful.  They
are tough to kill, so fly evasively
and don't get too close!  ÿ
