How may I serve the Emperor?
   You must protect the [Emperor]
as he heads for his Super Star
Destroyer.  The Emperor's private
luxury liner has fallen under attack
from forces loyal to the renegade
[Zaarin], a former Admiral in the
Imperial Navy.  Radio transmissions
have already been sent by the
enemy gunboats so it is likely that
Zaarin has been alerted as to the
Emperor's exact position.  Soon
Zaarin's forces will arrive in
numbers.  The Emperor's ship needs
about ten minutes to make it to
its hyperjump point.  The situation
is very dangerous as Coruscant is
too far away for a safe return
and the TIE Advanced escorts are
almost defeated.  The [Emperor]
must be saved or the future of
the Empire is in doubt.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly a [Missile Boat]
designated [Tau 1].  You will be the
only ship in your flight group.  For
this mission your craft has been
loaded with the standard armament
of [40 advanced missiles] plus a load
of [20 heavy rockets].  Your craft
will have the tractor beam installed.
// NEXT
What opposition should I expect?
   Expect the best of Zaarin's
forces in this battle.  With a
chance to remove the [Emperor]
from power, Zaarin will throw his
best forces into the battle.
Remember that Zaarin's personnel
are former members of the Imperial
Navy.  They have undergone the
same training as you and are flying
the same type of spacecraft.
But only you have the honor of
serving the [Emperor].

What did I accomplish?
   You saved the [Emperor] from
Zaarin's treacherous hands.  The
Empire is safe for the moment.
However Imperial Intelligence has
reviewed the action from the
previous mission.  It appears that
the gunboats that attacked the
Emperor's ship were part of the
Emperor's own special reserve
guard.  This proves that there are
still traitors loyal to Zaarin's
cause deep inside the Empire.  You
must remain vigilant against all
enemies of the Empire.  Your
loyalty and service to the [Emperor]
will not be forgotten.  Soon [Lord
Vader] will join the [Emperor] at
Endor for the Rebels' climactic
extermination.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   When the first corvette enters
the area switch to dual rockets
and use your SLAM booster to
deliver two rocket hits as quickly
as possible.  Then take out
gunboats [Mu 1] and [Mu 2].  It makes
a difference in how the mission will
unfold according to which gunboat
is destroyed first.  If more
corvettes arrive, use dual rockets
on them.  You should have just
enough rockets to do the job if
you use only two rockets per
corvette.  Fire your rockets up
close and from behind the
corvettes' engines.  If gunboats
and TIE Advanced show up instead
of the corvettes, priority targets
are the gunboats.  When attacking
gunboats, three advanced missiles
or one rocket will do the job.  Fire
your rockets while the SLAM is
engaged to increase their speed
and the probability of a hit.  ÿ
