// COMPLETION MESSAGES:
Alright, Alpha 2, looks like Zaarin will have to try again!
As soon as the area's cleared, enter the To-phalion Base
That data is too valuable to lose, destroy the shuttle at once!
At last we've rooted out Zaarin's spy on the Vorknkx project!
Errors in judgement there must be in war..
But not those due to confused thought and limited study!

// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   Now that the Rebels' spies have
been rounded up, the Emperor's
plan to trap the Rebels at [Endor]
may proceed.  In order to
completely restore peace to the
galaxy, the traitor Zaarin must
also be eliminated.
   The [Vorknkx Project] is once
again at risk.  Its new home,
[To-phalion Base] (formerly an
asteroid mining facility) is under
attack.  Grand Admiral Thrawn
anticipated Zaarin making such a
move and has planned a trap.  To
buy time for the necessary forces
to be positioned, the current
threat must quickly be neutralized.
   Due to combat losses and
Zaarin's treacherous attacks on
the missile boat production
facilities, it has been recalled from
combat duty.  You have been
reassigned to a TIE Advanced
squadron.  You will join T/A [Alpha]
and immediately hyperspace to the
area to stop Zaarin's attack.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   Welcome back to the TIE
Advanced.  Since you've been away
for awhile, you'll be going out in
the number two position.  You will
fly [TIE Advanced Alpha 2] (T/A
Alpha 2).  Your craft has been
armed with a special double load of
[16 advanced concussion missiles].
Also, your craft is fitted with a
[jamming beam].
   [To-phalion Base] used to be an
asteroid mine.  After the mine was
exhausted, the hollowed out
interior was set up with secret
research facilities and a huge
hangar bay.  Its surface defenses
include an anti-warhead launcher
and several turbolaser batteries.
Also, four smaller asteroids have
had anti-warhead missile defense
batteries positioned on them and
another four possess additional
turbolaser batteries.  Altogether,
they give the appearance of a
small cluster of asteroids.
   Finally, there was a squadron
of TIE Interceptors, but they
have almost all been wiped out
during the current attack.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   Enemy forces currently in the
area are three TIE Defenders and
four Muurian Transports.  The
Muurian Transport, while powerful, is
not an Imperial craft.  Its
presence here suggests that
Zaarin is starting to acquire new
ships from somewhere.
   Zaarin's forces have been
dwindling with each encounter and
he must not be allowed to recover
from these losses.  Any technology
[like the cloaking device] which could
improve Zaarin's chances must also
be kept out of his hands and
protected.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   Watch for anything unusual and
be prepared to receive new orders
at any time.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What have we accomplished?
   Zaarin's attack was defeated
and losses to enemy forces were
heavy.  [To-phalion Base] remains
strong despite some heavy
punishment.  Preparations for the
evacuation of the [Vorknkx Project]
have begun.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Order your wingmen to attack
the nearest TIE Defender, then
target one yourself and destroy
it with a pair of missiles.  Target
the third TIE Defender and fly
away from it until you're 2.5
kilometers away.  Turn to engage
with another pair of missiles, then
help your wingmen finish off the
first one.
   Now target the nearest Muurian
Transport and order your wingmen
to attack it as well.  Engage the
jamming beam when you're within 1.5
kilometers.  This will defeat the
target's fire control system,
preventing it from returning fire.
   Continue to destroy the
Muurian Transports in this manner,
breaking off as you feel
necessary to reload your warheads.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What have I accomplished?
   You stopped the escape of
Zaarin's spy and prevented the
loss of secret [Vorknkx Project]
data.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Watch for the unauthorized
shuttle launch when the spy
attempts to escape.  This will
occur when all of the TIE
Defenders are destroyed or three
of the Muurian Transports.  ÿ
