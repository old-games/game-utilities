// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   Thanks to your timely arrival,
Zaarin's initial attack on [To-phalion
Base] was thwarted.  Now, you must
protect [To-phalion Base] against a
second attack by Zaarin's forces.
Grand Admiral Thrawn is sending
reinforcements and will himself
arrive aboard the Nebulon-B class
Frigate [Maru Ki].  Once the [Maru Ki]
is here, Thrawn will personally
direct a counterattack against
the traitor forces.  You must hold
off the enemy until these
reinforcements arrive.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   As the new flight leader, you
will now fly TIE Advanced [Alpha 1]
(T/A Alpha 1).  You will lead a four
ship flight group out of [To-phalion
Base].  Your craft has been armed
with a special double load of [16
advanced concussion missiles].  Also,
your craft is fitted with a [jamming
beam].
   Zaarin's spy managed to
sabotage several of [To-phalion
Base's] defensive systems before
attempting to escape.  The main
base's shields are intact, but all
of the smaller asteroids have
suffered complete shield system
failures.  They are now extremely
vulnerable to being disabled by ion
cannon attack.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   Four Modified Corellian
Corvettes and a twelve ship
squadron of Assault Gunboats
have entered the area and are
moving into attack formation.  It is
assumed that the Assault
Gunboats will first disable the
smaller weapons platforms to enable
their quick destruction by the
Corvettes.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   Try to make short range
sensor scans of the Corvettes to
help us determine exactly what
Zaarin is planning.  Keep an eye
out for any other opportunities
to aid our intelligence gathering.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What have we accomplished?
   Once again the traitor's attack
was defeated and losses to enemy
forces were again severe.  With
the loss of the smaller weapon
platforms, [To-phalion Base] is now
extremely vulnerable.  Fortunately,
Grand Admiral Thrawn arrived before
it was too late and he will now be
able to coordinate the final demise
of Zaarin and his pack of traitors.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Clear the Assault Gunboats as
quickly as you can using missiles
and ordering your wingmen to help.
Reload your warheads and engage
the Assault Transports that have
begun to enter the battle.  The
quickest way to eliminate them is
to pick one that is at least 2
kilometers away and order your
wingmen to attack it.  Engage the
jamming beam and fire four missiles
at the target.  At least one of
your wingman should get a missile
off for the killing blow, but if not
massed laser fire will do the trick.
   Continue in this manner until all
Assault Transports are destroyed,
breaking off only whenever you
need to reload your warheads.
   Finally, engage the Corvettes
using essentially the same tactic.
However, as you begin an attack
on a Corvette you should first
target its warhead launcher and
destroy it with a missile.  (The
jamming beam defeats the fire
control system of cannons, but
does not the seeker heads of
homing warheads.)

What have I accomplished?
   You have helped confirm Grand
Admiral Thrawn's intuitions regarding
Zaarin's plans.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Watch for a good opportunity
to make a close flyby of two of
the enemy corvettes before any
are destroyed.  ÿ
