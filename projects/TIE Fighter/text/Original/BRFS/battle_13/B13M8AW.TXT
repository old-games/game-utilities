// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   The traitor Zaarin stole the
Corvette [Vorknkx] (our testbed for
the new cloaking technology).  He
then managed to escape deep into
the [Unknown Regions] before the
rest of Grand Admiral Thrawn's
strike force could pounce.
   The unforgivable delay in the
arrival of Interdictor Cruiser
[Corvus] would have meant disaster
were it not for the remarkable
foresight of Grand Admiral Thrawn.
He ordered a special tracking
device installed on the corvette
and we now know exactly where
Zaarin has gone to regroup his
forces.
   In the fierce battle around
[To-phalion Base], Zaarin lost most
of his remaining TIE Defenders.  We
will destroy the last of them in
this battle!  Our primary objective
is to destroy Zaarin once and for
all.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly [TIE Advanced Alpha
1] (T/A Alpha 1) out of Strike
Cruiser [Ebolo].  Your craft has
been armed with a special double
load of [16 advanced concussion
missiles], and fitted with a [tractor
beam].  You will have only one
wingman, so take care of him!
   Strike Cruisers [Ebolo] and [Daring]
will lead the attack on Zaarin's
Star Destroyer.  Interdictor
Cruiser [Corvus] is holding the enemy
in place as Thrawn directs the
battle from ISD [Grey Wolf].
   You will join with TIE Fighter
squadron [Eta] to destroy Zaarin's
TIE Defenders so that TIE Bomber
group [Beta] will be able to get
through to finish the traitors off.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   Former Admiral Zaarin has his
flagship, Imperial Star Destroyer
[Glory], and several TIE Defenders.
The Modified Corvette [Divine Wind]
and three Assault Transports are
attacking Interdictor Cruiser
[Corvus].
   There is also an Escort
Transport and a Muurian Transport
protecting ISD [Glory] by attacking
our Strike Cruisers.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   At the first opportunity make
a close fly by of ISD [Glory] so
that we may confirm that CRV
[Vorknkx] is still within its hangar.
The tracking device is not the only
secret aboard the [Vorknkx].  Grand
Admiral Thrawn has laid plans for
another "contingency!"
   Zaarin may attempt to abandon
ship aboard a fast shuttle or
other craft.  Stay alert to the
launch of any escape craft and
inspect them before you destroy
them.

What have we accomplished?
   We have avenged the Emperor
and expunged the stain of
treachery from the Imperial Navy!
Grand Admiral Thrawn's brilliant plan
maneuvered Zaarin into destroying
himself with stolen technology...a
fitting end for this despicable
traitor!
   Grand Admiral Thrawn knew that
if Zaarin believed the cloaking
device worked as well as the
reports suggested, he would try
to slip away aboard it if that was
his only alternative.  Thrawn had
had those reports altered, though.
Our scientists had explained to
Thrawn that the cloaking device
was dangerously unstable in the
presence of an activated
hyperdrive unit.
   We await word of the Emperor's
success against the Rebels at
Endor.  Only then will the enemies
of the Empire be completely
destroyed, and peace and order
restored throughout the galaxy!
You have earned the gratitude of
billions of sentient beings and the
favor of the Emperor.  Long live
the Empire!
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Immediately upon entering the
mission pull back on the stick so
you avoid a serious collision with
TIE Defender [Delta].  Order your
wingman to attack the nearest
enemy, then fly toward T/D [Delta 5]
and be ready to blast any
warheads launched at you.
   Once you've made it through
[Delta 5's] first pass you should
take out anybody who is attacking
your wingman.  This is usually T/Ds
[Delta 2, 3] and [4], and they can be
cleared quickly using the tractor
beam and a pair of missiles.  Keep
ordering your wingman to attack
whoever is attacking you.
   Stay alert for the launch of
TIE Defender [Z-Theta] and
intercept them immediately.  The
same with TIE Defender [Zeta].  With
the TIE Defenders essentially
cleared you should then take out
any surviving enemy transports
and the [Glory's] warhead launcher.
A good energy configuration for
fighting the T/Ds is cannons and
tractor beam at maximum recharge,
with the shield recharge redirected
to the engines.

What have I accomplished?
   You helped validate the final
details in Grand Admiral Thrawn's
plan.  Throughout your career you
have frequently played a crucial
role in dozens of critical missions.
Many has been the time when you
single-handedly tipped the balance
in favor of the Empire!  You have
earned dozens of commendations
and a chest full of medals.  Let
no one doubt that you are one of
the greatest living starfighter
pilots in the galaxy!
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Do a flyby of Imperial Star
Destroyer [Glory] at the earliest
opportunity.  When the [Glory's]
shields collapse, the escape
shuttles will start launching so be
ready to disengage from any
dogfighting and inspect them.  ÿ
