// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   The Garrett's forces need to
locate and retrieve the stolen
[missile boat] from the [Rebels']
possession.  [Tau 1] will be
responsible for inspecting the
containers to find the hidden
missile boat.  After the missile
boat's presence has been verified,
destroy the container.  The Rebels
acquired this missile boat from
[Namuura Din].  He was not only a
traitor to the Empire, but he also
has betrayed Zaarin by giving one
of the few missile boats in Zaarin's
hands to the Rebels.  With the
[Battle of Endor] imminent, the
Rebels must not have the
firepower of the missile boat on
their side.  It is imperative that
the Rebels never disassemble the
missile boat and learn its secrets.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly the only [missile boat]
left assigned to the Garrett.  You
will be designated [Tau 1].  There will
be only one ship in your flight
group.  For this mission your craft
has been loaded with the standard
armament of [80 advanced missiles].
Your craft will have the tractor
beam installed.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   You will be going up against a
[Rebel] stronghold.  This base will
probably have many Rebel
starfighters assigned to it.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   [Lord Vader] wants it confirmed
whether the missile boat has
already been disassembled or not.
When you locate the missile boat,
we will launch a craft to board and
take it.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP

// SKIP
What did we accomplish?
   The Garrett's forces stopped
the traitorous [Rebels] from using
the missile boat.  Imperial Command
does not think they had enough
time to disassemble and research
its technology.
   You will no longer be flying a
missile boat, as their combat use
has been restricted by the
[Emperor].  In a series of sneak
attacks, Zaarin has managed to
devastate the Empire's few missile
boat manufacturing capabilities.
Thousands of Imperial citizens were
slaughtered in the attacks.  All
existing missile boats are to be
put into protective storage until
further notice.  You are being
transferred and reassigned to TIE
Advanced Squadron Alpha where you
will serve under Grand Admiral
Thrawn.  Your starfighter skills are
needed to track down Zaarin once
and for all.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Work your way towards the
containers as you dogfight.  You
will only have a limited amount of
time before a Rebel craft arrives
to take the missile boat away.
First target the corvette and
check your Threat Display to see
which container it is headed for.
That container should have the
missile boat inside it so you can go
straight to the correct container.
Then destroy the Rebel corvette.
Ten advanced missiles, launched
from a distance, will do the job.
When the cruiser starts shooting
at the Garrett, fire advanced
missiles at its laser turrets to
suppress it.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What did I accomplish?
   By retrieving the [missile boat]
instead of just destroying it, you
have confirmed that this craft
was not disassembled.  Therefore,
the Rebels do not have its
secrets.  Once again the [Empire] is
victorious!
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Do not destroy the container
before our forces retrieve the
missile boat.  Provide cover for
the boarding craft until it
completes its mission.  ÿ
