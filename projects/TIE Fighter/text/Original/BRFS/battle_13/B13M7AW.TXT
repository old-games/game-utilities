// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   To protect [To-phalion Base]
against yet another attack by
Zaarin's forces.  Grand Admiral
Thrawn's plan to trap Zaarin is
almost complete.  The final
showdown is imminent.  We must only
hold out until the rest of our
forces can be brought to bear.
   The most important thing is to
ensure that Corvette [Vorknkx] is
not destroyed.  Precautions have
been taken in the event of its
capture, but it would be best not
to have those precautions put to
the test!
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly TIE Advanced [Alpha
1] (T/A Alpha 1).  You will lead a
four ship flight group out of
[To-phalion Base].  Your craft has
been armed with a special double
load of [16 advanced concussion
missiles].  Also, your craft is fitted
with a [tractor beam].
   Because of the sabotage
caused by Zaarin's spy, we lost all
of [To-phalion Base's] subsidiary
weapon platforms during the last
attack.  Fortunately, we have FRG
[Maru Ki] and its complement of TIE
Fighters, Bombers and
Interceptors.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   Former Admiral Zaarin has
arrived aboard his flagship Star
Destroyer [Glory].  A three ship
flight of TIE Defenders is leading
an attack, followed by six TIE
Bombers.  Admiral Thrawn's ship the
[Maru Ki] appears to be their first
target.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   Protect Grand Admiral Thrawn at
all costs.  All of Thrawn's
encounters with Zaarin have
taught him much of how the
traitor's mind works.  His presence
in the battle is critical.  He is
taking a great risk in the hope
that Zaarin's hatred of him will lead
Zaarin into making a fatal mistake.
   If Zaarin can be even partially
distracted from his attempt to
capture our new cloaking
technology, the rest of our
forces will arrive in time to trap
the traitors.
   Even if this ploy is
unsuccessful, Thrawn has allowed
for the possibility of the Corvette
[Vorknkx's] capture.  A cleverly
concealed tracking device has been
placed aboard the ship.  Wherever
Zaarin flees, we will follow!
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What have we accomplished?
   We ensured the survival of the
Corvette [Vorknkx] and its precious
cloaking device while waiting for
Grand Admiral Thrawn's main strike
force to arrive.  This was a tough
battle and we were outgunned from
the beginning.  Though our losses
were high, so were Zaarins.
   Corvette [Vorknkx] was
commandeered during the battle by
more of Zaarin's traitorous
followers, but we will soon recover
it.  Thrawn's contingency plan
included the installation of a
special tracking device so we can
catch Zaarin when he drops out of
hyperspace.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Order your wingman to attack
T/D Z-Delta 1 as you take out
Z-Delta 2 with a pair of missiles.
Switch to lasers and destroy the
missile that Z-Delta 1 may have
fired at you.
   Now try to shoot down as many
rockets headed for FRG [Maru Ki] as
you can.  Once T/I Z-Beta has
made its first pass, switch to
single missiles and try to destroy
the Interceptors as quickly as you
can.
   As new TIE Defenders enter
the area, order your wingmen to
attack whoever is attacking you.
You will periodically be forced to
deal with the TIE Defenders when
your wingmen prove less than
adequate at keeping them off your
back.
   Do not worry about stopping
Corvette [Vorknkx].  Contigency
plans have been made!  It is more
important to protect Grand Admiral
Thrawn and his officers when they
abandon the [Maru Ki] aboard
Shuttle [Lambda].
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What have I accomplished?
   You saved Grand Admiral Thrawn
by keeping Zaarin's TIE Defenders
away from his escape shuttle.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   When the [Maru Ki's] hull becomes
critical, two shuttles will launch.
The lead craft will be carrying
Grand Admiral Thrawn.  Save it to a
memory location and then check to
see if any of the enemy craft
have noticed it.  You must
intercept any attackers
immediately.
   As new TIE Defenders arrive,
the chances that one of them will
ignore you in favor of the
shuttles increases, so keep a
close eye on the shuttles!  ÿ
