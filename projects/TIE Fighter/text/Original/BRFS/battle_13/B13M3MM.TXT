// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   The Garrett's forces must
capture the Rebel Calamari cruiser
[Link].  The commander of the Link
knows that the [Emperor] is waiting
at Endor with the Imperial fleet to
spring a trap.  Namuura Din
confessed he gave the Rebel
commander the information just
before our forces captured him.
[Lord Vader] must learn how far this
top secret information has spread.
The Garrett's forces must stop
this flow of information before it
reaches the [Rebel High Command].
[Lord Vader] thinks that the
information about the [Emperor's]
plans was considered far too
important for the Rebel commander
to have entrusted it to any of
his officers or to radio through
normal channels.  He probably
wishes to carry this information
personally.  The outcome of the
[Battle of Endor] could rest on
what our forces accomplish today.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly a [Missile Boat]
designated [Tau 1].  You will be the
flight leader.  There will be two
ships in your flight group.  For
this mission your craft has been
loaded with the standard armament
of [40 advanced missiles] plus a load
of [30 advanced torpedoes].  Your
craft will have the tractor beam
installed.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   You will be going up against a
[Calamari cruiser] with many Rebel
type starfighters assigned to it.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   [Lord Vader] needs to know why
the [Link] has stopped here.  Is the
Link resupplying or possibly
dropping off the newly acquired
information?  With such crucial
intelligence, the most logical course
of action would have been to get
back to [Rebel Command] immediately.
They may be aware the Garrett is
close behind and want to eliminate
anyone following them before
leading Imperial forces to their
headquarters.  The [Emperor]
expresses great confidence in the
success of his master plan.  The
[Emperor] has yet to be wrong in
his predictions.  Keep your eyes
open and use your initiative.
Opportunity does not wait.

What did we accomplish?
   The Garrett's forces captured
the [Calamari cruiser Link].  The
[Missile Boat] escaped but our
forces accomplished the primary
objective, capturing the commander
of the Link.  Its commander has
confessed to [Lord Vader] that he
alone knew the truth about the
Emperor's plan.  All Rebel knowledge
of the trap waiting for them at
Endor has been suppressed.  This
operation was essential to
achieving victory at Endor.  [Lord
Vader] is very impressed with your
accomplishments.  The Rebel Cruiser
has been sent back to [Imperial
Intelligence] so concealed data may
be extracted from its computers.
Imperial ship engineers will enjoy a
closer look at an enemy capital
ship such as the Link.  Additionally,
our forces were able to follow the
[missile boat] to its new location.
Now that the Garrett has new
supplies onboard, it is time to
retrieve or destroy that missile
boat.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Use you warheads sparingly.
Immediately target the nearest
enemy starfighter, a [Z-95], and
order you wingman to attack it.
Quickly take out the remaining
[Z-95s] with a single advanced missile
each.  Use missiles along with the
tractor beam to destroy the
[A-wings].  Engaging the SLAM
boosters just before firing at an
A-wing will increase the probability
of a quick hit.  Beware, the
[X-wings] are armed with the
magpulse warhead.  After the area
is cleared of Rebel starfighters,
switch to advanced torpedoes and
destroy both of the cruiser's
warhead launchers.  Then proceed
to knock down its shields.  Beware
of A-wings Blue, they will launch
when the cruiser is attacked.  If
needed, go for a warhead reload.
Take out any [B-wings] as soon as
they appear.  Next, you will need
to destroy the [corvette] that
enters the area to protect the
Link from being boarded.  Stand
guard over assault transport
[Omega 1] until it has completed its
mission.

What did I accomplish?
   You confirmed what [Lord Vader]
has suspected all along.  The Link's
Commander has driven its engines
far too hard in order to travel
the distance required.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Inspect the container before it
gets destroyed.  Use the "ignore
current target" command, "Shift I",
to stop any attack on it by
Imperial forces.  ÿ
