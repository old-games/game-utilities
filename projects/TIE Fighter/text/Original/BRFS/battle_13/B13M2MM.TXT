// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   The Garrett's forces must
capture the Victory Class Star
Destroyer [Zeplin].  According to an
Imperial spy, Zaarin and his senior
staff know the truth about the
Emperor's plans for the Rebels at
Endor.  One of Zaarin's top
commanders, [Namuura Din], upon
discovering this information, has
decided to defect to the Rebel
side.  His command ship, the Zeplin,
is already at a rendezvous point
for a meeting with the Rebels.  He
hopes to convince them that their
planned attack on the Death Star,
located near Endor, will play into
the Emperor's hands.  Commander
Din is also supposed to trade a
missile boat that Zaarin had in his
possession to the Rebels.  This is
a dangerous turn of events.  If
the Rebels learn the truth about
the Death Star or gain the [Missile
Boat] technology, the balance of
power could shift greatly.  [Lord
Vader] wishes to interrogate Din as
soon as his ship is captured.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly a [Missile Boat]
designated [Tau 1].  You will be the
leader of the two ships in your
flight group.  For this mission your
craft has been loaded with the
standard armament of [40 advanced
missiles] plus a load of [30 advanced
torpedoes].  Your craft will have
the tractor beam installed.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   You will be going against a
[Victory Star Destroyer] plus its full
complement of starfighters.  Be
alert for Rebel forces as they are
expected to meet up with Namuura
Din soon.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   [Lord Vader] needs to know
where the missing missile boat is
located, in case it is not on the
Zeplin.  Inspect all freighters and
capital ships in the area.  The
more information you gather, the
better [Lord Vader] can deal with
these enemies of the Empire.

What did we accomplish?
   The Garrett's forces captured
the Victory Star Destroyer [Zeplin],
preventing it from being handed
over to the Rebels.  The [Zeplin]
has been sent to an Imperial
shipyard where [Imperial Intelligence]
will examine it.  The Commander,
Namuura Din, was also captured in
the operation.  [Lord Vader], in his
usual efficient manner, has
extracted important information
from Din.  The news is not good.
Ex-Commander Din learned from
Zaarin that the [Death Star's]
defenses are fully operational.
This information and one [Missile
Boat] were passed on to the
Rebels before our forces could
stop the Zeplin.  Vader also
learned that Zaarin has not
informed the Rebels of the
Emperor's plan at Endor.  The
[Emperor] has foreseen that Zaarin's
extreme hatred of the Rebels has
kept him silent on the matter.  He
prefers that the Rebel cause be
wiped out at Endor.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Head towards the Zeplin.  Order
your wingman to attack TIE Fighter
Beta 1 while you target Beta 2.
Try to destroy two TIE Fighters
on the first pass and leave the
third alone for now.  Next, take
out a couple of TIE Advanced that
will be targeting the gunboats you
are escorting.  Most important, do
not get hung up dogfighting.
Quickly take out Zeplin's warhead
launchers, using dual missiles or
torpedoes, to prevent its use of
advanced missiles.  The warhead
launchers are located near the
bridge of the Victory Star
Destroyer.  The safest place to
attack the warhead launchers is
from three kilometers above the
Zeplin.  You may have to eliminate
the launchers from up close if
necessary.  Once this is
accomplished, fire advanced
torpedoes at the Victory Star
Destroyer's hull until its shields
are down.

What did I accomplish?
   You inspected the Rebel cruiser
and located the missile boat.  The
Garrett must immediately go after
the Rebel cruiser and either
recover the missile boat or
destroy it.  Report for your next
mission immediately.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Use your SLAM boosters to
inspect the Rebel Cruiser at the
very start of the mission.  ÿ
