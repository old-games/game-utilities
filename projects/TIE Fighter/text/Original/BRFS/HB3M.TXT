// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   Your objective is to completely
destroy a Rebel depot of
transports, shuttles and
containers.  The Corvette Control
is your command ship and will stand
off while you attack.  The Rebel
transports will most likely try to
attack our Corvette.  So destroy
the transports first with the help
of your wingmen.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly [TIE Bomber Alpha 1].
You will be the flight leader of a 3
ship group.  Your craft will be
armed with [6] proton torpedoes.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   This is a surprise attack so
you have about 1 minute until the
Rebels should be able to power up
their craft and start
counterattacking.  Beware of the
shuttles as they are capable of
attacking your starfighters.

What have I accomplished?
   You have shown you are
capable of being a flight leader.
Remember, the more efficiently you
instruct your wingmen in going
after targets by using the
[Shift-A] command, the more
successful your flight group will be.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   This mission requires a quick
strike approach.  Target the
transports first by sending your
wingmen after them with a [Shift-A]
command.  As flight leader you
should keep your wingmen busy with
frequent targeting orders.  ÿ
