// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   The objective of this mission is
to destroy all craft at this Rebel
fighter base.  This will reduce the
Rebellion's effectiveness in this
sector.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly the [TIE Advanced]
designated [Alpha 1].  You will be the
flight leader of a 3 ship group.
Your craft will be armed with [8]
concussion missiles.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   This starfighter base is
equipped with all four of the Rebel
fighters.  They will be scrambling to
get them operational as you
attack.  Given the element of
surprise, you have a few minutes
before they start striking back.

What have I accomplished?
   You have successfully hampered
the Rebellion starfighter capability
in this sector.  Excellent work.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Work with your wingmen to
attack multiple targets at once.
If you attack the tugs first then
they will be unable to get the
Rebel starfighters operational.  ÿ
