// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   Attack and destroy a Rebel

against the starfighters and leave

designated [Alpha 1], the flight
leader in a three ship flight group.
Your craft will not have any
warheads.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?

What have I accomplished?
   You have successfully
destroyed a Rebel outpost.
Excellent work, the Rebel forces in
this sector have suffered a large
setback.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Fly directly to the Y-wings and
take them out before they can
get fully operational.  Assign your
wingmen to different targets than
to those that you are going after
to speed up the attack.  ÿ
