Keep up the good work, Alpha 2, you're doing well!
The raiders have been stopped
Well, the Rebels certainly are getting bolder!
Too bad for them they're not getting any smarter!
This is going to be difficult to explain
I wouldn't want to be you!

This mission designed for Peregrine Software, Inc. by >David Wessman  1994c
// NEXT
This mission recreates a typical Rebel raid on an Imperial Navy supply depot.
// NEXT
Six TIE Fighters from [Alpha] Squadron are maintaining a standard orbital patrol around [PLT Depot 5].
// NEXT
You will be expected to follow your flight leader's lead and do as he does.
// NEXT
If [Alpha 1] is taken out, [Alpha 2] (you) will assume command of the rest of [T/F Alpha].
// NEXT
Your primary objective is to intercept the raiders and destroy them!
// NEXT
Your secondary objective is to destroy any Rebel craft attempting to steal supplies.
// NEXT
Enter the simulation now and follow inflight instructions carefully.

// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   To learn to use the memory
locations of your targeting
computer to keep track of your
flight leader and the mission
critical craft you are protecting
(the platform).  Also, to practice
issuing inflight orders to your
wingman so you may see the
advantages of group tactics.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly [TIE Fighter #2] in a
flight group of six ships named TIE
Fighter group [Alpha].
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   The raid will commence with an
attack by [X-wings] followed by
[Y-wings].  If the Y-wings can
disable the platform, [Heavy Lifters]
will arrive to pick up as many
containers as they can.

What have I accomplished?
   You have demonstrated the
ability to defeat an enemy attack.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Use the "assign current target
to wingman" order to mass fire on
a particular target.  As soon as it
is destroyed assign a new target.
