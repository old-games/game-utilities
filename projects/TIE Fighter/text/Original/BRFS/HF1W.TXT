// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   To develop basic gunnery skills
and then apply them against an
increasingly challenging series of
targets.  As the mission
progresses you will have the option
to continue with actual dogfighting.
   Pay constant attention to
your [Threat Indicator Array].  It is
part of the HUD and will light up
when an enemy is aiming a weapon
at you.  Pressing the 'E' key will
target the enemy craft in your
CMD.  You can then "turn the
tables" on your opponent by
turning to attack.  Avoid head-on
attacks as these are usually
suicidal.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly [TIE Fighter Alpha 1]
(T/F Alpha 1.) It is the standard
starfighter of the Imperial Navy.
Armament consists of twin
chin-mounted lasers.  It has no
shields, but relies instead on speed
and agility to avoid enemy fire.
That's where your skill as a pilot
comes in!
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   There will be no opposition at
first.  In the dogfighting portion
of the mission the [Z-95
Headhunter] will be your enemy.  It
isn't as fast or maneuverable as a
TIE Fighter, but it has the same
armament and also boasts
deflector shields.

What have I accomplished?
   You have shown you are
capable of engaging enemy craft in
gunnery combat.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   You must always be ready to
make sudden unexpected maneuvers
to throw off an attacker.  Never
fly straight and level when there
is an enemy nearby.
   When you are outnumbered it is
sometimes best to put some
distance between your enemies and
yourself!  Try [redirecting] your
cannon recharge energy to your
engines at the [maximum] rate to
get the necessary speed.  ÿ
