Again you are going back to save [TIE Advanced] plant [ZA-13] and our supply convoy bound for it.

We expect [Rebel] forces to attack our Imperial resupply convoy just before it reaches the plant.

With only a few [TIE Advanced] plants left in existence, this mission is one of great importance.

// QUESTIONS: 
What are the mission objectives?
   To protect the TIE Advanced
factory [ZA-13] and the Imperial
convoy [Rope 17] that is enroute
with important plant equipment.
Since its recapture from Zaarin,
the ZA-13 facility has been
undergoing reconstruction and
upgrade.  Previously, it had been
responsible for hyperdrive engine
production only, but since the loss
of the Omar manufacturing
facilities, its assembly lines are
being expanded to allow for
complete TIE Advanced production.
The supply convoy that is
delivering the final equipment for
these assembly lines has come
under [Rebel] attack.  No doubt the
Rebels are trying to take
advantage of the recent
confusion going on inside the
[Empire].  Above all else, you must
ensure that the factory itself is
not destroyed by enemy forces.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will be the flight leader, [TIE
Defender Alpha 1].  You will have
two wingmen.  Your craft will be
armed with [16] advanced missiles.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   [Rebel] spacecraft have already
made one attack on the [Rope 17]
convoy while enroute to ZA-13.
[Y-wings] are now reported in the
area, so more [Rebel] craft are
expected once the [Y-wings] radio
back their findings to Rebel
command.  Hopefully the Rebels
have not coordinated their attack
with [Zaarin's] forces.  Defending
against such a combined attack
would be extremely perilous.

What did we accomplish?
   The TIE Advanced plant has
been resupplied and many [Rebel]
craft have been destroyed.  As of
now, the plant is guarded by a
pair of Nebulon B frigates.  Soon
the plant will be in full production
of TIE Advanced starfighters.
   During the recent engagement ,
the [Rebels] were using [mag pulse]
warheads.  This new warhead
technology temporarily disables
laser cannon weapon systems by
draining their stored energy.  This
latest advance in weaponry is not
completely understood, but appears
to be very useful.  Imperial
Command wants us to acquire
further information on this weapon.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   Concentrate on the [Y-wings]
and the [B-wings] because they are
the ones attacking the convoy.
Try to evade the [A-wings'] missiles
and concentrate on your primary
objective, saving the convoy.
Don't forget to assign targets to
your wingmen when needed.  When
attacking the [corvettes], target
their laser turrets to disarm them.
Once their shields are down, use
your ION cannons to disable them.
Once disabled, they can be
destroyed when convenient.
Remember to go for warhead
reloads whenever possible.  ÿ
