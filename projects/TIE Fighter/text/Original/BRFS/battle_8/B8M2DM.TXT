Your mission is to stop any craft from escaping with materials stolen from the factory.
// NEXT
Beware of unfriendly starfighters. [Zaarin's] forces have some of the best craft in the Fleet.

[TIE Advanced] factory [ZA-13] was under the direct supervision and control of [Zaarin].

// QUESTIONS: 
What are the mission objectives?
   You are to stop [Zaarin's]
forces from stealing equipment
from [TIE Advanced] hyperdrive
manufacturing plant [ZA-13].  This
facility assembles the hyperdrive
engine unit that gives the TIE
Advanced starfighter its unique
hyperdrive capability.  This same
hyperdrive unit can be converted
for use in the TIE Defender.  You
must destroy all of Zaarin's cargo
craft that are loading and
carrying off TIE Advanced
components and equipment from
ZA-13.
   There are alerts coming in from
all over the Empire, as [Zaarin's]
forces are looting and destroying
Imperial military manufacturing
installations.  These attacks are
focusing on TIE Advanced hi-tech
centers like the [Factory ZA-13]
plant.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will be the flight leader, [TIE
Defender Alpha 1].  You will have
two wingmen.  Your craft will be
armed with [6] torpedoes.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   You could come up against any
craft in the entire [Imperial Navy].
As head of new starfigher
technology, [Zaarin] had access to
all the latest Imperial spacecraft.
Therefore, you can expect to see
his forces equipped with the [TIE
Advanced] and possibly other
specially equipped TIE starfighters.
Reports from other attacks include
sketchy sightings of the [TIE
Defender] amongst his forces.
However, our intelligence analysis
suggests that Zaarin will not
commit his limited number of TIE
Defenders in this operation.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   Disable [Zaarin's] cargo-carrying
craft and let their cargo be
retrieved by our forces before
you destroy them.  The ship logs
on board will perhaps give us clues
to where the bulk of Zaarin's
forces are.

What did we accomplish?
   We stopped [Zaarin's] forces
from stealing vitally important
hyperdrive units that could have
been used for building TIE
Advanceds or converted for use in
building TIE Defenders..  From the
current round of attacks from
[Zaarin's] forces, it is clear that
they are securing supplies of
starfighter components, while at
the same time destroying the
Empire's access to this same war
material.  Zaarin is looking to gain
a clear technological advantage.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   First target and destroy the
two [corvettes], then the two
[mod/conveyors], and finally the
[Corellian transport].  Order your
wingmen to help attack a [corvette]
while still at a distance so they
can launch their warheads.  You
should fire four warheads at the
other [corvette].  Then move in
together and use your lasers to
blast them to space dust.  Use
two more warheads on one of the
[mod/conveyors] then switch back to
laser cannons.  Use lasers to
finish off the rest of the cargo
craft.  Try not to get caught up
in dogfighting until all the larger
craft have been dealt with.
Remember, they are your primary
objective.

What did I accomplish?
   You helped us retrieve most of
our top secret materials that were
stolen from the ZA-13 facility by
[Zaarin's] forces.  Not only would we
have lost months of progress on
TIE Advanced production, but
[Zaarin] could have used these
materials to undertake his own TIE
Advanced and possibly TIE
Defender manufacturing effort.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   If you order your wingmen to
help you attack the cargo craft,
watch its shields and call them off
as soon as its shields get low.
You don't want your wingmen
destroying any cargo craft before
the important cargo can be
reclaimed.  Disable the two
[corvettes] first, the [two
mod/conveyors] next and then the
[corellian transport] last.  Try not
to waste time dogfighting the
TIEs, the cargo craft are not
going to stick around long.
Remember to switch to ION cannons
as soon as the cargo craft's
shields go down.  ÿ
