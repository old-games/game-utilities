// QUESTIONS: 
What are the mission objectives?
   In an attempt to seriously
weaken the Empire's [TIE Advanced]
manufacturing capabilities, Admiral
Zaarin's forces are launching a
strike against the Empire's three
starfighter production facilities at
[Omar].  The Imperial forces
currently at Omar can't stop this
attack, so the Emperor has
ordered, as a precautionary
measure, the temporary evacuation
of the base personnel.  The highly
skilled workforce at these plants is
vital to keeping the Imperial Navy
equipped with the most advanced
starfighter technology.  They must
be saved!  Two of the factories,
Omar 2 and Omar 3, have been
completely evacuated, but plant
personnel are still awaiting rescue
from [Omar 1].  Your mission is to
ensure the safe withdrawal of all
personnel from this facility.  Omar
1 must survive long enough for the
last craft, Corellian transport
Timber, to board it.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will be the flight leader, [TIE
Defender Alpha 1].  You will have
two wingmen.  Your craft will be
armed with [8] advanced missiles.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   One of Zaarin's [modified
frigates] with all of its complement
of starfighters is already in the
area.  We expect [TIE Bombers]
launched from the [frigate] to
spearhead the attack.  Watch for
other enemy craft that hyper into
the area and reinforce the attack.

What did we accomplish?
   We saved a great number of
skilled Imperial technicians from
certain death at the hands of
[Zaarin's] traitorous forces.  The
surprise coup attempt by Admiral
Zaarin, former head of research
and development for starfighter
technology, has left Imperial
forces on the defensive.  His
inside knowledge of the Empire's
key military industrial facilities
leave them extremely vulnerable to
attack.  While Zaarin's exact
motivations and ultimate plans are
unclear at this point, his forces
are as great a threat as the
Rebels to the survival of the
Empire.  We can certainly expect
more attacks from Zaarin very
soon.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   Ignore the [frigate] and
concentrate on taking out all the
[TIE Bombers] it launches.  Position
yourself between the [frigate] and
[Omar 1].  Try not to let too many
[TIE Bombers] launch warheads.  If
any warheads are launched, try to
blast them as they pass.
Remember to order your wingmen to
help when needed.  ÿ
