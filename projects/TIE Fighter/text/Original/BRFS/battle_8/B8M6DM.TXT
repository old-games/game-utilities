>Strategic Warfare #6: Trapped

[Zaarin] is trying to trap us. We cannot hyper to safety because of their [interdictor cruiser].
// NEXT
[Alpha] group must take out the interdictor before it is too late. T/A [Beta] will provide an escort.
// NEXT
We only have [2] operational [TIE Defenders] and [1] [TIE Advanced] onboard.

We cannot count on our forces to arrive in time to save us.  Our survival is now up to you!
// NEXT
Not only will we lose the [mag pulse] technology, but more importantly our commander, [Admiral Thrawn]!

// QUESTIONS: 
What are the mission objectives?
   Admiral Zaarin has struck again!
He has sent an [interdictor] cruiser
to trap our forces around the
Rebel base that we have just
attacked.  He has followed our
efforts to gain the mag pulse
technology and now has sprung a
trap to destroy our forces there.
Until the interdictor is destroyed,
our forces will not be able to
hyperspace to safety.  Destroy
Zaarin's interdictor!
   Once again, Zaarin has
discovered our plans.  But there is
no time to find the security leak
now.  Attack the interdictor with
the new mag pulse warheads so we
can dispatch our three remaining
[TIE Bombers] to launch torpedoes
at it.  We will have only one chance
for survival and it depends on you.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will be the flight leader, [TIE
Defender Alpha 1].  You will have
one wingman.  Your craft will be
armed with [4] mag pulse warheads.
This warhead incapacitates its
target by disabling its weapons
system temporarily.  The mag pulse
warhead works best against larger
targets like capital ships, rendering
all of their defenses inoperable.
Be careful, though, their systems
are only disabled for a brief time!
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   Expect to face TIE
starfighters flown by Zaarin's best
pilots.  They will be launched from
either of [Zaarin's] capital ships.  Be
careful when going up against the
turbo lasers and missile systems on
the interdictor.

What did we accomplish?
   With the help of your heroic
efforts, our forces made it out
of there alive.  The newly promoted
[Admiral Thrawn] sends his personal
congratulations and wishes that
you join him in his efforts to
track Zaarin down.  The Emperor
has commanded [Admiral Thrawn] to
destroy Zaarin's forces and has
made available to him the best
resources in the Imperial Navy in
order to accomplish this.  You are
one of these resources.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   Get one mag pulse warhead hit
on each of the enemy capital ships
as soon as possible.  Launch each
warhead from as short range as
possible to minimize interception by
their defensive missiles and turbo
lasers.  Concentrate on taking out
the interdictor cruiser and escort
the TIE Bombers that are launched
to torpedo the interdictor.
Engage any aggressive TIEs when
overwhelmed.  ÿ
