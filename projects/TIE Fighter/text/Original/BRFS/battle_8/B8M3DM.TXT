// QUESTIONS: 
What are the mission objectives?
   Your mission is to assist
Imperial forces in boarding and
completely regaining control over
TIE Advanced plant [ZA-13].  Your
task in this operation is to see
that the transports carrying the
factory supervisors and damage
assessment team make it safely to
the factory.  Along with providing
escort cover, you must make sure
that the factory is not destroyed
by counterattacking forces.
   [Emperor Palpatine] has ordered
the continued construction of the
TIE Advanced as a top military
priority.  The Empire has lost a
good part of its war production
capabilities in the last few days.
This plant is one of the few
remaining factories involved in the
production of the TIE Advanced
anywhere in the Empire.  Imperial
command believes that we have not
seen the last of [Zaarin's] attempts
to destroy this installation.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will be the flight leader, [TIE
Defender Alpha 1].  You will have
two wingmen.  Your craft will be
armed with [8] heavy rockets.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   Again you could come up against
any craft in the entire Imperial
Navy.  Remember, [Zaarin's] forces
are well equipped and highly trained.
We expect to see more [TIE
Advanceds].  No other [TIE
Defenders] besides yours are known
to be in this area, so you should
have the superior craft in this
operation.  Be alert, [Zaarin's] pilots
were recruited from the best in
the [Imperial Navy] and were hand
picked by his personal staff.

What did we accomplish?
   We regained control over TIE
Advanced factory [ZA-13] and
stopped [Zaarin's] forces from
destroying it.  The factory will be
back in operation once the damage
has been assessed and repairs
completed by the crews that you
helped to deliver safely.  This
facility will contribute a vital part
in keeping the Empire's starfighter
forces superior to those of
Zaarin.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   Target a [corvette] and order
your wingmen to attack it
immediately.  As soon as they
destroy one [corvette], assign them
to attack another.  At the same
time, attack the [corvettes] with
your lasers.  Deal with the
gunboats in between runs on the
[corvette's] laser turret.  These
[gunboats] pose little threat to the
station.  When the three enemy
[transports] enter the area, stop
them.  You should save your
rockets for the [Carrack Cruiser]
that enters later in the battle.
Attack with your wingmen to divide
the [cruiser's] defensive fire power.
