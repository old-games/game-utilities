// QUESTIONS: 
What are the mission objectives?
   Our intelligence network has
uncovered the [Rebels'] source for
the mag pulse weapon which was
used against the Rope 17 convoy.
Our forces are to launch an
assault on the installation where
production of this weapon occurs.
We hope to obtain working copies
of the mag pulse weapon from the
platform.  Gaining this technology
will help in our arms race with
Zaarin.  We believe he already has
access to this technology.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will be wingman [TIE Defender
Alpha 2].  There will be three craft
in your group.  Your craft will be
armed with [8] heavy rockets.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   The [Rebels] are expected to
mount a strong defense of their
installation.  Currently only a small
number of Rebel starfighters are
stationed there, but we anticipate
reinforcements will be sent.  There
are also rumors that the Rebels
have a new experimental
starfighter, but information is
extremely limited.  Expect the
unexpected.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   Disable any craft fleeing from
the platform so our forces can
capture the occupants.  We wish
to capture prisoners to
interrogate, preferably officers
and technicians who worked on the
mag pulse weapons development
program.

What did we accomplish?
   We were successful in our
mission to capture several working
copies of the [mag pulse] warhead.
Unfortunately, while this operation
was underway, the [ZA-13] facility
came under attack by more of
[Zaarin's] forces.  Initial reports
indicate that Zaarin's forces were
successful in destroying the plant
along with a Nebulon B frigate.
Latest reports state that most
of the other TIE Advanced plants
have also fallen.  [Zaarin] has been
very thorough in ravaging Imperial
factories.  The [Emperor] is not
pleased with the news of the loss
of the TIE Advanced plants.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   Immediately target the platform
and order your wingmen to attack
it.  With any luck they will get a
couple of rockets off while you
quickly launch five of your own.
Then engage the [Z-95s] that are
trying to intercept you.  Toggle to
full laser and shield recharge.
Concentrate on taking out the
starfighters.  [X-wings] and [T-wings]
will enter the battle next.  Try to
dogfight outside the range of the
platform's turbo lasers if it is not
disabled already.  Use your wingmen
to assist you in destroying the
starfighters.  When the Rebel
[corvettes] enter, attack using two
more rockets on one of the
[corvettes].  Use wingmen to assist
in destroying the second [corvette]
when it becomes a threat to the
platform.

What did I accomplish?
   You helped us capture most of
the top [Rebel] staff trying to
escape.  We were also able to
capture many important specialists
who worked on developing and
manufacturing the mag pulse
weapon aboard the platform.
Excellent work.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   When the platform is disabled, a
transport will try to make its way
to safety.  Break off whatever
you are doing and disable it as
soon as possible.  Tell your wingmen
to ignore that transport so they
do not destroy it in the heat of
the battle.  ÿ
