// COMPLETION MESSAGES:
Very good, Alpha 2, you may return to base now!
Or we can stick around and try to take down that cruiser!
Excellent work, Alpha 2! Lord Vader will hear of your skill!
Return to base now
Your performance is very disappointing
Maybe the new Avengers are more than you're ready for?

// MISSION: 
>TIE Advanced Combat #2: Rocket Attack
// NEXT
This mission designed for Peregrine Software, Inc. by >David Wessman  1994c
// NEXT
Patient observation of a Rebel supply cache has paid off!  The [FRG Inamo] will be vulnerable during refit.
// NEXT
The attack will be made by a full squadron of TIE Advanced split into two elements of six ships.
// NEXT
[T/A Alpha] will initiate the attack by launching heavy rockets at the Nebulon-B class frigate [Inamo].
// NEXT
[T/A Beta] will destroy the supply cache and watch for enemy fighters.  (Beta will be armed with missiles.)
// NEXT
Historically, the [Inamo] was destroyed quickly and then the Rebel cruiser [Ardent] arrived.
// NEXT
Though most of their rockets had already been used, [T/A Alpha] courageously attacked!
// NEXT
In the ensuing engagement, the [Ardent] was severely damaged before escaping into hyperspace.
// NEXT
Avoid taking unnecessary risks.  If you start taking excessive casualties you should withdraw.

// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   To practice [rocket] attacks
against enemy starships.  You
should learn how to acquire and
hold a lock for the rocket's homing
system before firing.  When
targeting large ships notice that
you may target individual
components of the hull, engines,
etc.  You may even "surgically"
remove the enemy ships armament
by targeting the individual lasers!
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly the [TIE Advanced],
designated [Alpha 2] of a six ship
flight group.  Your ship has been
fitted with rocket launchers and
armed with the standard load of [4]
warheads.
   [Rockets] are similar to
torpedoes but do more damage.
They are also slower and do not
track as well.  Remember, you can
engage starships as far as [6]
kilometers away.  This allows you to
engage the enemy while remaining
outside the range of his guns.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   First you will engage a
[Nebulon-B class frigate].  This is a
medium sized starship with
formidable firepower.  A variety of
Rebel starfighters will appear to
harass you.
   The second starship is a [Mon
Calamari MC-80 class cruiser].  It is
a larger starship with essentially
the same armament.  They are
almost always deployed with at
least one squadron of
starfighters.  (In this case, one
squadron of [Z-95 Headhunters] is
on board.)

What have I accomplished?
   You have demonstrated the
ability to destroy enemy starships
using rockets.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   During the attack, try to
reduce the target's ability to
defend itself by targeting its
laser turrets and guns.  ÿ
