// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   To protect the delivery of
critical supplies to Zaarin's
research platform.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly an [Assault Gunboat]
designated [Tau 2].  There will be
four Gunboatsin your flight group.
For this mission your craft has
been loaded with a special
armament of [16] advanced
concussion missiles.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   Your opposition is unknown.
After the last attack we can be
sure the Rebels haven't finished
trying.  The security leak will be
ferreted out soon enough.  Until
then, your vigilance is required.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   You have served the Emperor
well.  Your loyalty will be rewarded.
Continue to do your duty.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What did we accomplish?
   We prevented another Rebel
raid and thwarted their attempt
to capture the convoy.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Rendezvous with the convoy as
quickly as you can.  Order your
wingmen to engage the X-wings as
soon as they arrive.  Switch to
dual fire missiles and rapidly take
out one or two B-wings.  Now take
out the Rebel Assault Transports.
Return your attention to the
B-wings.  When they are all
eliminated, you can help finish off
the X-wings.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What did I accomplish?
   You helped capture one of the
Rebel's B-wings with their new
weapon.  It is a homing warhead
that appears to disable only the
weapon systems of the target
craft.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   When you intercept the B-wings,
remember to disable one or two
rather than destroy them all.
When the A-wings arrive, disengage
from the X-wings and go after the
A-wings.  They will try to destroy
any B-wings you have disabled for
capture.  ÿ
