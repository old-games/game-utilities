The smallest details often have the largest consequences
The [Emperor] will be very disappointed
[Lord Vader] was planning to personally test the new craft!

// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   The TIE Defender prototypes
are being transported to
Coruscant.  They were picked up
at Zaarin's research facility by
three Cargo Ferries.  At the
rendezvous point near [Vinzen Neela
5] the prototypes will be
transferred to a more heavily
defended craft, the Escort Carrier
[Hininbirg].  Your primary goal is to
thwart the Rebel ambush during
this transfer operation.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly the [TIE Advanced]
designated [Alpha 2].  There will be
three craft in your flight group.
For this mission your craft has
been loaded with a special
armament of [8] advanced
concussion missiles.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   Your opposition is unknown.  A
small but significant Rebel
starfighter force can turn up
almost anywhere at anytime.  Be
vigilant!
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   The Emperor is disturbed by
the security breach at Zaarin's
research facility.  You must gather
evidence on who is behind the leak.
Inspect any Rebel starships for
clues on how the Rebels discovered
this rendezvous was taking place.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What did we accomplish?
   You disrupted the Rebels
attempted ambush and ensured
that ESC Hininbirg received the TIE
Defender prototypes.  The Hininbirg
will deliver the new fighters to
Coruscant for the Emperor's
inspection.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Attack the Corvettes first.
As you close on the minelaying
Corvettes, fire a pair of missiles
at each laser turret.  Order your
wingmen to go after the X-wings
while you finish off the Corvettes.
Take out mines while you make
firing passes on the Corvettes.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What did I accomplish?
   You faithfully followed your
orders by inspecting the
Corvettes.  We are analysing the
results.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Inspect the two Corvettes
before they finish their minelaying
operation and hyperspace out of
the area.  ÿ
// LAST
