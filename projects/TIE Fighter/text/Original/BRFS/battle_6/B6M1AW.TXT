// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   The [TIE Advanced], after much
delay, has finally reached the
frontline units and has begun to
see action against the Rebellion.
Admiral Zaarin's team has continued
working on improving the TIE series
of starfighters and has built
prototypes of a radically
redesigned TIE.
   Six prototypes of this newest
TIE starfighter designated the [TIE
Defender] are to be taken to the
Emperor at Coruscant for his
personal review.  Your task is to
ensure the safety of the loading
operation.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly a [TIE Advanced]
designated [Alpha 2].  There will be
three ships in your flight group.
For this mission your craft has
been loaded with a special
armament of [8] advanced
concussion missiles.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   Opposition is unknown.  Security
at this installation is very tight,
but we're not taking any chances.
If there have been any leaks, we'll
know soon enough!

What did we accomplish?
   You and your wingmen
intercepted the Rebel raiders and
prevented them from stopping the
loading operation.  The prototypes
are safely on their way to the
Emperor on Coruscant.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Take out the [B-wings] first.
Use your missiles in dual fire mode
to kill them as quickly as possible.
Use the "assign current target to
wingmen" order to make sure that
any B-wing you aren't personally
attacking is at least forced out
of its torpedo run.  ÿ
