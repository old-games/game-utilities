[GUN Tau] will lead the attack. Destroy any opposition and disable any craft attempting to escape.
// NEXT
[ATR Omega] will enter the area [three minutes] after the attack starts.

// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   Our objective in this mission is
to make an example of [Galactic
Electronics].  For trading with the
enemy, the corporation's assets
are to be seized by the Empire.
Our task is to take over the
research platform where they
developed the [Mag Pulse]
technology which they sold to the
Rebels.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly an [Assault Gunboat]
designated [Tau 2].  Your flight
group consists of six Gunboats.
For this mission your craft has
been loaded with a special
armament of [16] advanced
concussion missiles.  Assault
Transport group Omega will enter
after you've had three minutes to
punch through the platform's
fighter defenses.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   The research platform is well
armed and has hangar facilities for
an entire squadron of Z-95
Headhunters.  They shouldn't cause
you too much trouble.  Use a
single missile on each to rapidly
clear them away.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   Assist with the capture of any
craft fleeing from research
facility.  Protect our Assault
Transports as they board and
capture the base personnel.  Also,
be alert for an opportunity to
disable a Rebel craft carrying the
[Mag Pulse] technology.
// NEXT

// SKIP
What did we accomplish?
   We demonstrated the folly of
working in opposition to the stated
aims of the Empire.  Selling weapons
to our enemies is an intolerable
act of treason.  The punishment is
death!
   Now, some good news for you!
You have been selected to receive
advanced combat training in the
new TIE Defender.  Report to the
Combat Chamber and select the TIE
Defender missions.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Use your missiles to quickly
take out at least six of the Z-95
Headhunters.  Since your wingmen
will usually go after the #1 craft
of each enemy flight group, you
should target the #2 and proceed
through your target list.
   Place the Transport and
Shuttle in memory and watch for
the message that the Transport
has finished docking.  Be sure to
be close by when this happens so
you can disable it quickly.  Now
target the Shuttle and disable it.
The Corellian Transport will launch
from the platform now and you can
intercept and disable it.
   Go back to killing Z-95
Headhunters.  When they're all
gone, lend assistance to the
Assault Transports trying to
disable the platform.

What did I accomplish?
   You helped us capture another
Rebel starfighter equipped with the
[Mag Pulse] weapon.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Watch for the arrival of the
Rebels soon after the capture
operations begin.  Try to take out
a couple of the Y-wings quickly,
then disable one or two of the
remainder.  It helps to have saved
some missiles.  ÿ
