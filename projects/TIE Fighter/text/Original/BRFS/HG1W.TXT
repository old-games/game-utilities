// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   You will learn to manage your
energy systems.  You now have to
balance the energy between your
cannons, shields and engines.
Depending on the circumstances of
the moment you will have to adjust
for greater firepower, defense or
speed.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly [Assault Gunboat Mu
1] (GUN Mu 1.) This is the first
Imperial Navy starfighter to have
deflector shields and a hyperdrive.
Armament consists of two lasers
and two ion cannons mounted in
the nose.  There is also a dual
warhead launcher.  For this mission
your ship will be fitted with a
standard load of [16] concussion
missiles.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   Your "enemies" will be a small
field of Type 1 mines.  They are
armed with a single omni-directional
laser cannon.  They can be
destroyed with a single cannon
shot.
   Alternatively, you can use your
missiles.  This will allow you to
destroy the mines from outside
their cannon range, but this is an
expensive strategy and your score
will be much lower!  Follow the
orders you receive in flight.  You
may be given the option to pursue
other goals.

What have I accomplished?
   You have demonstrated the
ability to clear a minefield.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Keep your speed up high and
don't fly straight and level any
longer than you have to to get
off a shot.  Try setting your
cannon recharge rate to [maximum]
and your shield recharge rate to
minimum.  Then remember to keep
transferring energy from the
cannons to the shields.
   If you are still having trouble,
use missiles.  Remember to stay
outside the range of the mines.
(Just stay at your starting
position, throttle at zero, and pick
them off at your leisure.) ÿ
