// COMPLETION MESSAGES:
Good work, Beta 2! We made short work of that platform!
You may return to the hangar or join the attack on platform 2
Outstanding, Beta 2! You've earned some R and R
This has been a very bad day for the Rebels!
If you'd only keep your wits about you this wouldn't happen!
Please pay better attention next time

// MISSION: 
>TIE Bomber Combat #2: Space Bombs
// NEXT
This mission designed for Peregrine Software, Inc. by >David Wessman  1994c
// NEXT
The Nebulon-B class frigate [Implacable] will lead an assault on a group of three Rebel space platforms.
// NEXT
[Platform A's] strike team will consist of 3 TIE Bombers ([T/B Beta]) and 3 TIE Advanced ([T/A Alpha]).
// NEXT
[T/B Beta] will make inertial bomb attacks using [space bombs] while the Advanced will deal with any fighters.
// NEXT
[T/B Delta] & [T/A Gamma] will attack [Platform B]. First team may assist, or proceed against [Platform C].
// NEXT
[ATR Mako] will be on station to reload your craft.  You may have [Mako] board you [five] times.
// NEXT
Make your rendezvous well away from the battle area so as not to endanger the [Mako].
// NEXT
The third platform will be attacked directly by [Implacable] with the strike teams joining in.
// NEXT
You need only participate in the first attack, but feel free to help destroy the other platforms!

// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   To practice attacking with
[space bombs].  You will learn how to
acquire and hold a lock for the
bomb's limited homing system before
firing.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will pilot a [TIE Bomber],
designated [Beta 2] of a three ship
flight group.  For this mission your
craft has been fitted with
launchers for [space bombs] and
armed with the double load of [4].
   A [space bomb] is a very heavy
warhead weapon that relies on the
inertia provided by the launching
craft to reach its target.  Space
bombs have target homing systems,
but their propulsion system is
limited to minor course corrections
after separation from the
launching craft.
   After you have "dropped" your
bombs Armed Transport [Mako] will be
available for you to receive as
many as [5] reloads.  Try to
conduct the reloading operation as
far from enemy threats as
possible.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   Each of the space platforms is
well armed with defensive laser
batteries.  In addition they are
each home to a handful of Z-95
Headhunters.  Remember that the
TIE Bomber is not well suited to
dogfighting so be wary of the
Z-95 Headhunters.

What have I accomplished?
   You have demonstrated the
ability to place space bombs on
target.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   These platform's defenses are
weakest in their lower hemisphere.
Try taking out the laser turrets
underneath and then make all of
your cannon attacks from below.
If the platform is shooting at you,
evade and fly away.  Wait until it
starts shooting at someone else,
then turn back to the attack.  ÿ
