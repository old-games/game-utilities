The battle between the [Habeen] and the [Nharwaak] for control of the hyperdrive technology continues. 
// NEXT
The Habeen have requested our help. Their research facility is under Nharwaak attack. 
// NEXT
A pair of old corvettes that have just unloaded cargo are their only defense.

The Nharwaak are using Y-wing starfighters. It will be a slaughter if we do not stop them.

The [M/CRV Phoenix] will hyperjump there to intercept the attacking Y-wings.

// QUESTIONS: 
What are the mission objectives?
   You are to stop an onslaught
of [Nharwaak] Y-wings from
destroying the Habeen Research
outpost before it can be
evacuated.  Imperial intelligence has
learned that in retaliation for our
attack on their base, the
Nharwaak are planning to launch a
reprisal raid on the Habeen
technology research center.  [TRN
Runner] and two Imperial shuttles
will rescue the base personnel.  If
the containers are destroyed
before all three rescue craft have
docked, you have failed your
mission.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will be flying a [TIE Bomber]
designated [Alpha 1].  Your craft will
be armed with [16] concussion
missiles for use in shooting the
Nharwaak raiders.  You will have two
wingmen in your flight group.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   You can expect to confront
the remnant [Y-wings] of the
Nharwaak fleet.

What did we accomplish?
   You have driven off the attack
and secured the area.  The Habeen
were able to successfully evacuate
their research team and vital
equipment.  The Imperial Navy's
effort here has gone a long way
in finalizing a deal between the
Habeen and the Empire for their
hyperdrive technology.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   Use your wingmen to attack
other Y-wing while you deal with
one yourself.  Target and fire
concussion missiles at the
attackers as quickly as you can.
[TRN Runner] and the two shuttles
must dock with the cargo
containers to rescue the base
personnel.  ÿ
