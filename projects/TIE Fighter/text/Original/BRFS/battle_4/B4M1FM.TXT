// QUESTIONS: 
What are the mission objectives?
   [Admiral Zaarin] has been
entrusted with overseeing TIE
starfighter development by Emperor
Palpatine and Lord Vader.  The R&D
facility he commands has been
completing the design of the
production version of the [TIE
Advanced].  This latest TIE
starfighter is derived from Lord
Vader's specially modified TIE
fighter.
   Zaarin's scientists had hoped
to perfect a hyperdrive engine
that could be added to the TIE
Advanced.  However, they have not
found a design that is reliable and
small enough to be installed on a
TIE craft.
   A breakthrough has been
achieved by a group of scientists
working for the [Habeen] and the
[Nharwaak].  Admiral Zaarin has
negotiated to get demonstration
versions of the new hyperdrive
technology to evaluate.  The
Habeen and Nharwaak are located
in the Outer Rim territories on
[Mylok IV] and are currently not
members of the Empire.
   Your mission is to escort the
Habeen convoy of 4 Cargo Ferries
to a rendezvous with Zaarin's ship.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will be piloting a [TIE Fighter]
designated [Alpha 2].  You will be a
wingman in your group of 3
starfighters.  Your craft will have
[8] concussion missiles installed.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   We do not expect trouble.
However, the [Habeen] admit that
their recent allies and
co-developers of the new
hyperspace technology, the
[Nharwaak], are not as eager to sell
their advancements to the Empire.
In fact, they are leaning towards
doing business with the Rebellion.
Therefore, the Nharwaak may try
to intervene with their Y-wings and
Z-95 Headhunters to stop the
convoy.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   Verify that the [Cargo Ferries]
are carrying the cargo that
matches their manifests.  They
should be carrying new starfighter
technology.  In this time of
rebellion and terrorism, it pays to
double check everything.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What did we accomplish?
   The Cargo Ferries have
successfully unloaded their cargo
on to the Shamus.  Zaarin's
research scientists are already
hard at work conducting a
preliminary analysis of the Habeen
technology.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   Your priority should be to take
out those [Y-wings] that are
attacking the Cargo Ferries.  Don't
get distracted by the Z-95s that
are battling the other TIEs.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What did I accomplish?
   You ensured that the Habeen
convoy was carrying technology
related cargo.  The Habeen
technology could bring new
advances to the TIE starfighter
line.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   Before the battle commences,
do a quick flyby of all the Cargo
Ferries to inspect their cargo
holds.  ÿ
