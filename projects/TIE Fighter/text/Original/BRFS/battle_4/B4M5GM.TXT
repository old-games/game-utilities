// QUESTIONS: 
What are the mission objectives?
   Imperial intelligence reports
that the [Nharwaak] are trying to
follow through with their threat to
hand over their version of the
hyperdrive technology to the
[Rebels].  This can not be allowed.
You will join in on the attack on
the Rebel forces that are loading
equipment from the Nharwaak.  We
must destroy Rebel [FRG Xerxes].
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will be flying an [Assault
Gunboat] designated Tau 1.  Your
craft will be armed with [16]
concussion missiles.  You will be the
flight leader and have two wingmen
in your flight group.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   The Rebels are placing great
importance in obtaining this
technology.  They will be throwing
their best pilots and starfighters
into the battle.  We expect to see
A-wings, X-wings and Y-wings.

What did we accomplish?
   We have prevented the Rebels
from gaining access to this prized
technology.  We have also
destroyed a large portion of their
starfighter squadrons and one of
their valuable frigates.  Well done!
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   When concentrating your attack
on the [FRG Xerxes], use your
missiles to surgically remove its
laser guns and turbolaser turrets.
When it has been stripped of its
defenses, you can finish it off.  ÿ
