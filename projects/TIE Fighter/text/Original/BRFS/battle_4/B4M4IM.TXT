// QUESTIONS: 
What are the mission objectives?
   Admiral Zaarin's negotiations with
the [Habeen] have reached a pivotal
point.  All the business terms of
the technology transfer deal have
been hammered out.  Only the
formal signing of the agreement
and the recognition of the Habeen
and their full rights as Imperial
citizens remain to be finalized.
The Empire and the Habeen will
rendezvous to seal this deal.  You
will patrol the rendezvous site,
protecting the Shamus and the
Habeen from any last ditch attack
from the Nharwaak.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will be flying a [TIE
Interceptor] designated [Alpha 1].
Your craft will be armed with [6]
concussion missiles.  You will have
two wingmen in your flight group.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   Despite our best attempts to
keep the rendezvous site a
secret, we expect that the
Nharwaak will find out about the
meeting and try to disrupt it.  If
they do attack, they will likely
attack with [Y-wings] and [Corvettes].
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   You are to inspect the four
transports that the Habeen will be
sending to the Shamus.  You must
verify that their cargoes are the
technology they have promised.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What did we accomplish?
   We have secured the area and
concluded the treaty signing.
Most of all, the Empire has gained
the new hyperdrive technology
which enables the TIE Advanced
project to be completed.  Soon
these remarkable craft will be put
into service and you will gain the
benefits of this new technology.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   Do not be confused as to who
is who.  If a targeted craft has
purple text in the CMD for its
name, it is an enemy.  The craft
with the blue text are the Habeen
whose forces we are supporting.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What did I accomplish?
   Excellent, you verified the
cargo contents.  The last
transport contained some type of
advanced weapon's technology that
is totally new.  We will have to
investigate this further.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   Keep alert for the radio
message that announces that the
first transport is being sent to
the Shamus.  There are a total of
four transports to inspect.  ÿ
