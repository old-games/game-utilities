// QUESTIONS: 
What are the mission objectives?
   The [Nharwaak] are incensed that
the [Habeen] are willing to sell their
jointly developed technology to the
Empire.  They have defied all
attempts at peaceful negotiation
and have recently threatened to
sell the hyperdrive technology to
the Rebellion.  The Rebels could use
this technology to upgrade their
existing fleet of hyperdrive
capable craft.  We can not let
this technology be sold to the
Rebels.
   Therefore, in this mission we
are launching an attack on the
Nharwaak base where the
technology is being stored.
Destroy all cargo carrying vessels,
let no ship escape!
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will be flying a [TIE Bomber]
designated [Alpha 2].  Your craft will
be armed with [6] proton torpedoes.
You will have two others in your
flight group.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   The Nharwaak are being supplied
by the Rebels with older model
starfighters like the [Y-wing].
These craft will likely be used to
defend their base.  The base is
also defended by [Corvettes].

What did we accomplish?
   The Nharwaak base was
eliminated and the cargo containers
and the Corvettes were destroyed.
Further reconnaissance patrols are
needed to determine if all the
Nharwaak technology has been
destroyed.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   Tell your wingmen to attack one
of the Corvettes while you attack
the other.  Six torpedo hits should
destroy a Corvette.  Make sure
both Corvettes are destroyed
before going after other craft.  ÿ
