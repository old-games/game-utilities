Very good, T/I Gamma 2, you have done well

// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   Your objective is to lure a
Rebel cruiser into an ambush.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly [TIE Interceptor]
designated [Gamma 2].  You will be a
wingman in a three ship flight
group.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   The platform is well armed with
defensive lasers.  There are a
number of [Z-95 Headhunters] and a
[System Patrol Craft] for local area
defense.  The Rebel cruiser is a
medium sized starship of significant
combat power.  It can launch up
to one full squadron of [X-wing]
and/or [Y-wing] starfighters.

What have I accomplished?
   You have taken part in a major
operation to strike a Rebel base
and lure a capital ship to its doom!
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Use the "assign current target
to wingman" order often.  If there
are no starfighters for you to
engage, attack the platform (or
the cruiser) to draw fire away
from the Bombers.  Your ability to
evade is much greater than theirs,
but they have the heavy weapons.
