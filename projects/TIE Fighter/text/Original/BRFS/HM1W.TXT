// COMPLETION MESSAGES:
Very good, Mu 1! That was pretty easy, though wasn't it?
Stick around for a reload and a new challenge...a convoy!
Bravo, Mu 1! You can see how formidable the Missile Boat is!
Soon you will have the opportunity to demonstrate it to Zaarin!
The Missile Boat isn't too complicated for you is it?
We can always put you back in an ordinary TIE Fighter!

>Missile Boat Combat #1: Dual Warheads
// NEXT
This mission designed for Peregrine Software by$>David Wessman 1994c
// NEXT
This mission will teach you basic assault tactics using the dual warhead armament of the new Missile Boat.
// NEXT
Your target will be a Rebel deep space manufacturing facility and all the nearby cargo containers.
// NEXT
You will use advanced concussion missiles to take out the facility's anti-warhead defense system.
// NEXT
Then make a stand off attack using rockets to destroy the installation from a safe distance.
// NEXT
Then you are to destroy any cargo containers or other craft using missiles or rockets as appropriate.
// NEXT
If you wish, you may remain in the area to engage a supply convoy and then a relief force.
// NEXT
The cruiser [Arjun] will arrive to deliver a combat utility vehicle for you to reload your warheads.

// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   To practice assault tactics on
a fixed installation using the dual
warhead capability of Cygnus' new
Missile Boat.  You will learn how to
choose the appropriate warhead
for each target.  Specifically, you
will learn how to overwhelm the
target's defensive anti-warhead
system with a saturation attack.
Once this is done, you can destroy
the facility using your heavy
weapons without fear of having
your warheads intercepted.
   In addition, you will learn how to
use the [S]ub[L]ight [A]cceleration
[M]otors.  The SLAM is an overdrive
that boosts engine output to
[200%] providing a sudden massive
boost of acceleration.  The cost
is a rapid drain on stored cannon
energy.  This technology is a new
development that is intended to
enable the Missile Boat to counter
the TIE Defender.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly [Missile Boat Mu 1]
(MIS Mu 1).  This craft is a
development of the successful
[StarWing] Assault Gunboat from
Cygnus.  It is faster and more
maneuverable than the Gunboat,
(see the data regarding the
SLAMs.) Like all new Imperial
starfighters, it is equipped with a
hyperdrive and deflector shields.
   Armament consists of two
large-capacity twin warhead
launchers and a single nose
mounted laser.  One pair of
launchers is dedicated for missiles
and holds a total of [40].  The
other pair is general purpose to
allow mission specific warhead loads.
There is also provision for special
beam weapons.
   For this mission your craft is
armed with [20 heavy rockets] in
addition to the standard missile
load.  Also, you will have the new,
[improved tractor beam].
   The only weakness is the
energy recharge rate.  Due to the
single cannon, it takes just over
[90 seconds] to reach maximum
energy levels from the nominal
mission start levels.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   The deep space manufacturing
facility you are going to attack
possesses defensive armament
consisting of [12 twin turbo lasers]
and an [advanced anti-warhead
system].  The nearby storage yards
and the facility itself may also be
protected by a number of [Z-95
Headhunters].
   You will drop out of hyperspace
less than [13 kilometers] from the
facility.  As you close the
distance, (attack range 6
kilometers), charge your shield and
laser systems to maximum.
   If you wish to continue after
the facility is destroyed, a combat
utility vehicle will be deployed for
you to reload your warheads.  You
may then proceed to attack a
convoy and a relief force.

What have I accomplished?
   You have demonstrated the
ability to use the Missile Boat's
dual warhead capability in combat
against a variety of targets!
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Remember that because you
only have one laser cannon, you
have a lot less energy to draw on
for power transfers to the
shields.  For this reason, you need
to avoid taking hits as much as
possible.  You shouldn't have any
trouble doing this as you have
ample standoff capability with your
many warheads.
   When enemy starfighters are a
threat, use the SLAMs to put
some distance between you.  Also,
try tricking the enemy fighters
into chasing you far away from
your real target, then use the
SLAMs to race back to your
target.
   Another trick you should
remember is to use your tractor
beam to "hold" an enemy craft for
your missiles to home in on.  Even
if you are forced to break your
hold, you can reacquire it a
moment later.  If your missile is
still tracking, it won't have any
trouble catching the craft you've
"painted" with your beam.
   Kill the tugs to prevent them
from saving any shuttles.  ÿ
