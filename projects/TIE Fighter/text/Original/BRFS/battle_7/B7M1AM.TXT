// QUESTIONS: 
What are the mission objectives?
   Lord Vader has discovered the
location of Harkov's traitorous
fleet.  With their leader gone,
Harkov's men are bent on turning
their fleet over to the Rebels.  As
the first step in destroying
Harkov's fleet, the Interdictor
Harpax will hyperspace into the
Ottega system and use its gravity
well generators to trap Harkov's
flagship the Victory class Star
Destroyer [Protector].  Our
reconnaissance flights report that
the Protector is currently taking
on Rebel supplies.  Your mission is
to take out the Rebel cargo
containers near the Protector and
protect the Harpax from
counterattack.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will be flying a [TIE
Advanced] designated [Alpha 1].  Your
craft will be armed with [8]
concussion missiles.  You will be the
flight leader and have one wingman
in your group.  Your craft will also
be equipped with a tractor beam
weapon.  This weapon, when turned
on with the ['B'] key, will prevent
your targeted craft from
maneuvering out of your sights.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   Harkov's Star Destroyer, the
[Protector], has a full complement
of Imperial Navy starfighter
squadrons.  Therefore, you'll have
to face off against the entire
range of our own TIE fighters.
The Rebels may be on hand as well,
so keep alert for their attacks.

What did we accomplish?
   We destroyed Harkov's resupply
efforts and staved off the first
wave of their attack on the
Interdictor Harpax.  Get back to
the briefing room as soon as
possible, as the Harpax in perilous
straits!  It is surrounded by the
Protector, the Rebel Lt.  Cruiser
Warhawk and a defecting frigate,
the Akaga.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   Immediately head for the Rebel
containers, destroying them as
quickly as possible.  Be wary of
the laser batteries from the
Protector.  Dogfight with the
Protector's starfighters only until
the Rebel cruiser arrives.  It
launches a barrage of Z-95s and
X-wings against the Harpax.  Don't
let them take it down.  ÿ
