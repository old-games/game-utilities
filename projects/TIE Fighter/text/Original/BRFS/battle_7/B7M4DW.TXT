From there you will proceed to [Coruscant] to stop Zaarin.  Other forces are rushing there, also.

// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   To rendezvous with Modified
Frigate [Osprey] en route to
Coruscant to warn the Emperor of
Zaarin's treachery.  Your superior
combat skills have earned you the
great honor of being personally
selected by Lord Vader to
accompany him on this mission.  You
will be responsible for ensuring
Lord Vader's success!
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly the new [TIE
Defender] designated [Delta 1].  Your
flight group consists of five TIE
Defenders.  For this mission your
craft has been loaded with a
special armament of [8] advanced
proton torpedoes.
   Lord Vader will pilot [Delta 6],
but you will command the flight
group.  A word of advice:  don't
issue any inflight orders to the
Dark Lord!
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   Opposition is unknown.  [Admiral
Zaarin] commands considerable
forces and there is no way to
know what traps he has laid until
we find them.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   In the event of an ambush you
will have to fight your way out.
Nothing must stop Lord Vader from
reaching the Emperor.

// SKIP
// SKIP
What did we accomplish?
   We broke through the trap laid
for us by Admiral Zaarin.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Launch your torpedoes at
[Interdictor Harpago] as soon as
you're in range.  Then take out
the Gunboats as quickly as you
can.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What did I accomplish?
   You helped destroy the
Interdictor cruiser Admiral Zaarin
had hoped to trap us with.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Use your torpedoes early and
order your wingmen to attack the
Interdictor.  Take out the
Gunboats as quickly as you can to
keep them from breaking up your
wingmen's torpedo runs.  ÿ
