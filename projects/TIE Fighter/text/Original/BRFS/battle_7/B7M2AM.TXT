// QUESTIONS: 
What are the mission objectives?
   The Harpax, in its attempt to
pin down the forces that Harkov
used to command, has put itself in
a precarious position.  Harkov's old
flagship, the Protector, the
Frigate Akaga, and the Rebel
commanded Lt.  Cruiser Warhawk are
all closing in to finish the Harpax
off.  Your mission goal is to
attack the Frigate [Akaga], thus
buying some time until Lord Vader
can arrive in the Imperial Star
Destroyer [Garrett].
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will be flying a [TIE
Advanced] designated [Alpha 2].  Your
craft will be armed with [2] heavy
space bombs.  You will be the only
wingman flying beside your flight
leader.  Your craft will also be
equipped with the tractor beam
weapon.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   Once again you will face a
mixture of Imperial and Rebel craft.
The Protector will launch standard
Imperial Navy starfighters and the
Rebel Cruiser will throw its
contingent of Y-wings and Z-95s
into the fray.

What did we accomplish?
   Excellent work!  We destroyed
the Frigate [Akaga] and bought a
little more time for the [Harpax].
The Imperial Star Destroyer
[Garrett] commanded by Darth Vader
himself has arrived to take charge
of finishing off Harkov's fleet and
putting an end to this mass
defection.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   Attack the frigate immediately.
Drop your bombs at a distance and
move out of their flight path.  If
you miss with the first set of
bombs, be sure to request a
rearming from your reload craft.
Keep an eye on the Harpax as well.
