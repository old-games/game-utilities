// QUESTIONS: 
What are the mission objectives?
   Admiral Zaarin has committed the
ultimate deceit.  While feigning
support in the battle against
Harkov's forces, Zaarin is
attempting to overthrow the
Emperor by abducting him from his
Imperial Star Destroyer at
Coruscant.  You must locate and
save the Emperor.  [Inspect] all
craft until you find the one that
is carrying the Emperor.  Then
[disable] the craft so it can be
boarded.  The loyal Vice Admiral
Thrawn will arrive to help in the
effort to save the Emperor.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will be flying the [TIE
Defender] designated [Alpha 1].  Your
craft will be armed with [16]
advanced concussion missiles.  You
will be the flight leader and have
two wingmen in your group.  Lord
Vader will oversee the action in his
TIE Defender, designated Alpha 4.
Be sure to follow any of his
orders.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   Once again you will be engaging
[Imperial craft].  Zaarin's forces are
the most advanced and well
equipped of all Imperial Navy craft.

What did we accomplish?
   You have rescued the Emperor
and saved the Empire!  The
mutineer, Admiral Zaarin, was able
to escape, though Vice Admiral
Thrawn followed his starship into
hyperspace.  We can only guess at
what provoked Zaarin to attempt
his coup d'etat.  Hopefully we can
gain some answers when Thrawn
tracks him down.  For now, Emperor
Palpatine and Lord Vader are
pleased that Imperial order has
been restored.  Your efforts and
accomplishments in the past
battles have been impressive.  You
have proved to be one of the
greatest Imperial Navy starfighter
pilots!
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   Order your wingmen to attack
Zaarin's TIE Advanced starfighters.
This will give you the breathing
room you need to inspect the
escort shuttles.  As soon as you
find the one that is carrying the
Emperor, disable it.  Your wingmen's
zeal to attack the escort
shuttles may get the better of
them, so use [Shift I] to order
them to ignore the Emperor's
shuttle.  ÿ
