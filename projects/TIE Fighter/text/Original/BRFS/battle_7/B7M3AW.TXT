// MISSION: 
>Treachery at Ottega, Mission #3: Retribution
// NEXT
The Rebel and defecting forces are closing in on [INT Harpax].  If they can destroy it, they will escape.
// NEXT
Lord Vader's plan calls for [Admiral Zaarin] to bring his forces in for the final destruction of the enemy!
// NEXT
The [Interdictor] is the key to this plan.  As long as it survives, the enemy is trapped.
// NEXT
[T/A Alpha] will lead the attack force to eliminate any enemy vessel that gets too close to the Harpax.
// NEXT
[CRL Warhawk] is the greater threat because [VSD Protector] isn't fast enough to catch the Harpax.

// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   The defecting forces led by
[VSD Protector] and their Rebel
allies are all to be destroyed.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly a [TIE Advanced]
designated [Alpha 2].  For this
mission your craft has been loaded
with a special armament of [6]
advanced proton torpedoes and a
tractor beam weapon.  You will be
able to reload via Transport [CUV
18f1].  TIE Advanced group [Gamma]
will make rocket attacks against
the enemy starships, while TIE
Advanced group [Theta] deals with
any enemy fighters.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   [VSD Protector] is leading the
defecting forces, but the Rebel's
[CRL Warhawk] has taken the brunt
of our counterattack so far.
Both ships must be destroyed.
Both sides are undoubtedly sending
reinforcements so stay alert for
any new arrivals.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   Stay alert to new developments.
Be prepared to take the initiative
when appropriate.

What did we accomplish?
   We eliminated the defector's
flagship.  At the same time we
ensured the survival of Lord
Vader's ship.
   The arrival of Admiral Zaarin's
forces on our enemies' side can
mean only one thing.  Admiral Zaarin
is moving against the Emperor!
Lord Vader is determined to return
to Coruscant to warn the Emperor
if there is still time.
   The [Garrett] has suffered some
critical damage and can't make it.
There is hope, however, because
Lord Vader had transferred the
new TIE Defender prototypes to
this ship in the hope of
conducting operational trials with
them.  This isn't the kind of test
he had in mind, but they are the
only craft available that could
make it in time.  You have been
selected to lead the effort!  Lord
Vader will accompany you.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   If CRL Warhawk is present, take
it out first.  Otherwise, go directly
after VSD Protector.  Fire all of
your torpedoes as soon as you're
within range, then turn back for a
reload.  Remember to try and take
out your target's armament first.

What did I accomplish?
   You helped destroy all of the
forces [Admiral Zaarin] sent against
us.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   The Modified Corvettes can be
destroyed with 4 advanced
torpedoes.  By the time Corvettes
arrive you will undoubtedly be out
of warheads.  Be sure to rearm
from Transport [CUV 18f1].  ÿ
