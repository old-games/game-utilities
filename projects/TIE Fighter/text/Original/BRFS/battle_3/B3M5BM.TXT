// QUESTIONS: 
What are the mission objectives?
   As our construction on the
NL-1 station nears completion, [Vice
Admiral Thrawn] wishes to conduct a
formal inspection of the facility.
Be prepared to escort his
transport from the Star Destroyer
[Stalwart] to the station.  When
[Vice Admiral Thrawn] has completed
his inspection, we will require you
to escort him back to his Star
Destroyer.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will be the flight leader in
a [TIE Bomber] designated [Alpha 1].
You will have one wingman.  Almost
all of our TIE Fighters and
Interceptors are out of service
undergoing maintenance repairs at
this time.  We have no choice but
to use the TIE Bomber in a
defensive role, something it was
not designed to do.  If and when
combat occurs you'll need all your
starfighter savvy to hold your
own.  Fortunately your craft will
be specially equipped with a double
load of [16] advanced concussion
missiles.  These brand new missiles
are faster, have better homing
capability and carry a larger
warhead than the standard
concussion missiles.  A [resupply]
craft is standing by, waiting to
reload your weapons should you
run out.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   We do not have reliable
intelligence on the Rebels' present
strength in this area.

What did we accomplish?
   We have defeated the Rebel
attack.  It was a close call, but
[Vice Admiral Thrawn] survived
unscathed.  He was impressed with
our ability to improvise with the
[TIE Bomber] and use it effectively
in a defensive role.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   Use half of your missiles for
escorting [Thrawn] to the station.
Use the other half of the missiles
on the [Pakuuni pirate] shuttles
that attack [Thrawn's transport]
during its return trip.  You have
the ability to reload your weapons,
but the pace of the battle may
not give you time.  ÿ
