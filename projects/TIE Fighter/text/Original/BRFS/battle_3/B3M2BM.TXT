// QUESTIONS: 
What are the mission objectives?
   [Vice Admiral Thrawn] has been
given the duty of ridding the
[Outer Rim Territories] of pirates
and smugglers.  One of the bases
they have been using is an
outpost in the [Pakuuni] system.
Your task is to lead the assault
on this base and to destroy the
Corellian Corvettes that are
protecting it.  This base must be
systematically and completely
destroyed so that a new Imperial
facility may be constructed in its
place.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will be flying [TIE Bomber]
designated [Alpha 1].  Your flight
group will consist of three craft
and you will be flying lead.  Your
craft will be armed with a double
load of [12] proton torpedoes.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   We can expect to see [Z-95s]
and [Y-wings] among the pirate
forces.  There are also reports
that the Rebels are providing
protection.  So be on the lookout
for the standard Rebel
spacecraft.

// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   Inspect the enemy [containers]
before you destroy them.  You may
find contraband for us to
capture.

// SKIP
What did we accomplish?
   Excellent, you have helped
destroy the pirates main staging
area for launching attacks against
intergalactic commerce.  Now we can
begin to build an Imperial outpost
to prevent further predatory
attacks on legitimate trading
vessels.  A strong Imperial
presence here will help trade to
flourish again.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   Tell your wingmen to attack one
of the [Corvettes] while you attack
another.  Six torpedoes in a row
should destroy a [Corvette].  Next,
take out any [Z-95s] that are
attacking you.  Leave the
containers for last.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What did I accomplish?
   You helped us to find [Rebel
advisors].  The Rebels have an
extensive presence in the area.
We have begun to interrogate the
prisoners, and we hope to have a
great deal of information soon.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   Inspect all the [containers]
before destroying them.  If [Rebels]
are found, wait until they are
captured before destroying the
[container] they are using.  ÿ
