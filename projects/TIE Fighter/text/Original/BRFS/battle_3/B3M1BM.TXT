// QUESTIONS: 
What are the mission objectives?
   At the cargo transfer area
near the planet [Argoon], we plan to
pickup the equipment and material
needed for the construction of a
new space installation in the [Outer
Rim Territories].  This area has been
mysteriously abandoned.  We
suspect the Rebels are up to
something here.  Our main goal is
make sure the right equipment is
found and loaded onto the
Victory-Class Star Destroyer
Stalwart, we can then deal with
whatever the Rebels may have in
store for us.  Therefore, inspect
all the containers in the area
looking for station assembly
material.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will be flying a [TIE Bomber]
designated Alpha 1.  You will be the
sole craft in your flight group.
Your ship will be armed with [8]
concussion missiles.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   Our reconnaissance flight found
the area to be abandoned with no
sign of the base personnel or any
craft.  We suspect the site was
abandoned when the Rebels signaled
their intentions to destroy the
cargo transfer area.  So be alert,
a Rebel attack may be imminent.
Inspect the containers as quickly
as possible.

// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   Inspect the abandoned
[containers].  Do not destroy any
containers that hold cargo.  We
wish to salvage any base equipment
that may still be here.

// SKIP
What did we accomplish?
   Good work, you have identified
and located the equipment we need
to build the new space installation.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   Inspect [all] containers before
you engage enemy starfighters.
We must find those that contain
the base equipment.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What did the loading operation accomplish?
   Good work, the [Heavy Lifters]
successfully loaded the base
equipment on to the [STD Stalwart].
We now have all of the equipment
needed for the new base's
construction.
// NEXT
How did the loading operation go?
   The Heavy Lifters did not
finish their pickup of the cargo
containers and delivery to the
Stalwart.  Protect the lifters until
all [5] of them have returned with
their cargo loads.  Remember, do
not destroy any containers that
hold cargo.  ÿ
