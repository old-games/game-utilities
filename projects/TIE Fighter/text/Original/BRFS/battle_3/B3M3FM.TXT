The pirates' outpost in [Pakuuni] system was destroyed during our last engagement.

We have orders to defend our position and wait for the convoy carrying the new space installation.

The convoy should arrive in fifteen minutes. You will escort it here when it shows up. 
// NEXT
We are running low on active TIE Bombers, so your [TIE Fighter] has been modified to carry missiles.

// QUESTIONS: 
What are the mission objectives?
   Your mission is to clear the
area around the [M/FRG Ludwick].
Stop any enemy craft from
launching warheads at our command
ship.  The Imperial Navy has
established its first foothold in
the Pakuuni system as part of its
objective to clear the area of
pirates and Rebels.  Intelligence
expects that they will not give up
this sector easily.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will be the flight leader in
a [TIE Fighter] designated [Alpha 1].
You will have three wingmen.  Your
craft will be armed with [8]
concussion missiles.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   The pirates from the Pakuuni
system and the Rebels will combine
forces to throw a variety of
craft at you.  We expect the
entire range of starfighter attack
craft to be brought into this
battle.

What did we accomplish?
   Our forces repulsed the
combined attack against the
Ludwick.  We held out long enough
to have the relief forces and the
construction unit arrive.  We are
on the verge of having this
system under Imperial control.  [Vice
Admiral Thrawn] is very pleased with
the performance of his TIE
starfighter units.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   Stop X-wings Yellow, B-wings Red
and Z-95 Headhunters Gold.  They
are armed with heavy rockets which
do the greatest damage.  ÿ
