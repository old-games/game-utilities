// QUESTIONS: 
What are the mission objectives?
   Construction on the new space
installation [NL-1] is proceeding well.
It is nearing completion and all
systems are operational except
the shields, which are functioning
at only 50% of their normal level.
The final work will be finished
shortly.  You are to defend the
area around the new [Station] and
the [Ludwick], driving off any Rebel
attack.  They have yet to
concede this area of space to
Imperial control.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will be the flight leader in
an [Assault Gunboat] designated [Tau
1].  You will have two wingmen.  Your
craft will be armed with [12] proton
torpedoes.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   The Rebels and the Pakuuni
pirates are continuing their
attempt to disrupt construction
of the new base.  They will
continue to use quick assault
tactics using hyperdrive capable
starfighters and Corvette class
vessels.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   Watch for an opportunity to
disable a craft that is carrying
high ranking [Rebels].  We need more
information about [Rebel] plans in
this sector.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What did we accomplish?
   The Rebel attack was repulsed.
The new station NL-1 suffered
minor damage but repairs and the
last of the construction are
proceeding well.  We hope that the
Rebels have realized the futility of
their attempts to break the
Empire's resolve in establishing a
major outpost in this sector.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   Order your wingmen to attack
one of the [Corvettes].  Weaken
each Corvette with two of your
torpedoes.  After launching the
torpedoes and making sure the
Corvettes are finished off,
destroy any [X-wings] or [Y-wings]
that are attacking your base.  Be
aware that the [X-wings] and
[Y-wings] are armed with torpedoes.

// SKIP
// SKIP
What did I accomplish?
   You helped us to capture a
group of high ranking officers.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   If you destroy both Corvettes,
the officers onboard may try to
escape.  Be ready to pounce on
them.  ÿ
