// QUESTIONS: 
What are the mission objectives?
   The construction of [Station
NL-1] is complete.  Final
preparations are being made to
make the outpost fully operational.
Vice Admiral Thrawn's Star
Destroyer [Stalwart] has just
completed delivery of two IPV-1
System Patrol Craft.  These high
speed craft will be used to monitor
and inspect vessels passing
through this sector.
   The [VSD Stalwart] will depart
shortly to escort the final convoy
to this station.  During its
absence, you will fly space combat
patrol to protect against Rebel
attacks on the station.  The
Rebels and their pirate allies
continue to contest this region of
space fiercely.  Protect the
station and the two new Patrol
Craft against enemy attack.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will be flying an [Assault
Gunboat] designated [Tau 1].  You will
be paired with one wingman.  Your
craft will be specially equipped with
[12] proton torpedoes.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   The [Rebels] will be staging a last
ditch effort to disrupt and
destroy the Imperial efforts in
this sector.  The attrition from
previous engagements has stripped
the Rebellion of its medium-sized
capital ships, however they still
have plenty of Assault Transports
and captured Stormtrooper
Transports.  Expect these to be
used in the coming battle.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   Be alert for an opportunity to
capture members of the Rebel
staff.  The Rebel battle
commanders are typically aboard
the transports.  It is from here
that they direct their forces
during the action.

What did we accomplish?
   This last victory insures that
the Rebels will be driven out of
the Pakuuni sector for good.  With
strong Imperial military presence
now in place, the Empire has
secured this sector from falling
prey to banditry and piracy.  You
are to be commended for your
participation in this operation.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   The Rebels are using a
multi-pronged attack utilizing
Assault Transports, Stormtrooper
Transports and B-wings.  The
other Rebel craft are
concentrating on escort and
attacking our starfighters.  Focus
on protecting the most vulnerable
of our craft first, the [System
Patrol Craft].  These are being
attacked by the Transport group
[Rover].  Be sure to use your
wingman.
// NEXT

// SKIP
What did I accomplish?
   You helped us to capture Rebel
officers.  Excellent, they will tell
us much.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   When the transports are
destroyed, be on the lookout for
a shuttle escaping with Rebel
staff members.  ÿ
