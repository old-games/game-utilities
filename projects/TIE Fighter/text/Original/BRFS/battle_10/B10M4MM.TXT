// QUESTIONS: 
What are the mission objectives?
   Your mission is to capture any
and all [TIE Defender] class
starfighters that may be aboard
the [Tarrak] Arms Merchant cruiser.
You will provide fighter cover for
the [gunboats] that will attack and
disable the [cruiser] and for the
boarding craft.  Tarrak's previous
attack confirmed that her forces
possess operational TIE Defenders.
Imperial intelligence has confirmed
that she plans to sell a great
portion of these to the Rebels.
Admiral Thrawn has ordered the
capture of these starfighters to
keep them out of Rebel hands.  To
ensure the success of this critical
operation, this mission will debut
the [missile boat], created by
Thrawn to outmatch the TIE
Defender.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will be the flight leader,
[Missile Boat Tau 1].  You will have
one wingman.  Your craft will be
armed with 2 sets of [40] advanced
concussion missiles.  It is time to
put your combat chamber training
in the missile boat to the ultimate
test, real combat.  The future of
the Empire rests on Thrawn's
missile boat and your ability to
pilot it to victory!
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   Tarrak's main starfighter force
is equipped with [T-wing] fighters.
The last battle proved that she
has some [TIE Defenders]
operational but we are unsure how
many she is selling to the Rebels
and how many she is keeping for
her own force.  The cruiser
carrying the [TIE Defenders] is
supposed to rendezvous with the
[Rebels], so keep your eyes open.

What did we accomplish?
   We retrieved [8] new [TIE
Defenders] and many prisoners from
aboard the cruiser.  A few of the
prisoners have "volunteered"
detailed information about their
leader, [Tarrak], and her exploits.
They have identified the location
of the manufacturing plant that is
already producing [TIE Defenders].
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   Don't spare the missiles, you
should have more than enough.
Use them like unguided rockets at
very close range and don't wait
for a complete red lock.  On your
first pass try to take out four
[T-wings] from the first wave of six
that are headed toward you using
single missile fire.  Then go after
the transports laying mines, using
dual missiles.  Finish off all the
[T-wings] that are launched, then
destroy any mines left.  ÿ
