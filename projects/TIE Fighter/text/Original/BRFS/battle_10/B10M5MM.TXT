// QUESTIONS: 
What are the mission objectives?
   You are to ensure the total
destruction of all [Rebel] craft and
see that the [Grey Wolf] remains
safe.  The Rebels have good cause
to be upset since we captured
the [TIE Defender] cargo from Ali
Tarrak that was en route to their
base.  They are mounting a major
counterattack to recover the [TIE
Defenders] that are on board the
[Grey Wolf].  Stop their attack and
then take out their Carrack
cruisers.  This will be great
opportunity to demonstrate to
them the true meaning of
firepower carried in the missile
boat.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will be flying [Missile Boat
Tau 1].  You will have no wingmen.
Your craft will be armed with [40]
advanced missiles and [10] heavy
bombs.  Use your advanced
concussion missiles against the
Rebel starfighters, while saving the
heavy bombs for use against the
Rebel cruisers.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   It's been a while since we've
dealt with a major assault by the
Rebellion.  Remember, their craft
are superior and their pilots
better trained than the pirates
we've been encountering lately.
Keep an eye open for
torpedo-carrying craft like [X-wings]
or [Y-wings] that may attack the
[Grey Wolf].
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   Destroy all shuttles or
transports that launch from the
cruisers.  Let no [Rebels] escape,
especially the officers from the
cruisers.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What did we accomplish?
   We held out against a major
assault, destroying a large number
of [Rebel] craft.  The loss of three
Carrack cruisers should greatly
hamper the Rebellion's effort to
challenge the Empire.  This Rebel
setback guarantees that they will
not get their hands on any TIE
Defenders.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   Use dual missiles to stop the
[X-wings] and [Y-wings] when they
appear.  Use the beam weapon
along with dual missiles on the
[A-wings].  It only takes [6] heavy
bombs and a few laser blasts to
take out a [Carrack cruiser].  Drop
[6] bombs on one cruiser and your
remaining [4] bombs on another.  The
[cruisers] carry a pair of [Z-95s]
each so be ready to intercept and
destroy them.  Go for a weapons
reload if there is a break in the
battle.

// SKIP
What did we accomplish?
   Excellent work, you prevented
the escape of the Rebel
commanding officers.  Their
elimination should be a major blow
to the already depleted Rebel
officer corps.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   Watch for an escort shuttle
that launches from Kingdom 1.  It
launches just before the cruiser
is destroyed.  Destroy the shuttle
before it can hyper from the area.
