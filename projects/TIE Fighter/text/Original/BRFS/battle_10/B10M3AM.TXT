// QUESTIONS: 
What are the mission objectives?
   Imperial reconnaissance probes
have detected movements of
military spacecraft preparing for
an assault on the Imperial cargo
transfer area near the Yrrna
system in the Outer Rim.  This
report has attracted special
attention because the spacecraft
involved are under the direction of
the pirate leader Ali Tarrak.  Also
there are indications that a Rebel
starship is in the area.  It is
feared that Tarrak may be using
this remote base as an initial
target for a new campaign against
the Empire.  Why she has chosen
this base or what part the Rebels
are playing in the upcoming attack
is unknown.
   Admiral Thrawn and the Emperor
himself are gravely concerned over
the possible proliferation of TIE
Defenders.  So potent a
starfighter must not fall into
enemy hands.  You are to report
to the Yrrna base and protect it
during the upcoming attack.
Hopefully you will learn more about
Tarrak's plans.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will be the flight leader, [TIE
Advanced Alpha 1].  You will have
one wingman.  Your craft will be
armed with [8] advanced missiles.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   The report from the modular
conveyor [Ulzepdi] that is trying to
escape Tarrak's attack said that
[TIE Defenders] were attacking the
Yrrna base but that the [Ulzepdi]
itself was being pursued by
[T-wings].  Protect the [Ulzepdi] until
it reaches hyperspace.  The
thought of dogfighting enemy [TIE
Defenders] strikes great fear in
most pilots, so we are counting on
you to complete this mission.

What did we accomplish?
   Excellent work, you rescued the
[Ulzepdi] and uncovered extremely
valuable information.  Tarrak's
forces have procured TIE
Defenders, or worse yet, have set
up production facilities of their
own for building the TIE Defender.
The presence of Rebels as
observers of the attack probably
indicates that Tarrak was using
the assault to demonstrate the
awesome power of the TIE
Defender to the Rebels!  She
probably intends to sell these
spacecraft to the Rebels!  This
must not happen.  All enemy TIE
Defenders must be recaptured or
destroyed.
   Admiral Thrawn has been
secretly developing a
countermeasure to the TIE
Defender.  Report to the combat
chamber to learn about this latest
Imperial super weapon.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   Position your craft between
the oncoming [T-wings] and the
[Ulzepdi].  Use your lasers to
destroy all the rockets they
launch.  Save your missiles and use
your lasers to destroy the three
T-wings.  Next you need to
intercept the four transports
headed towards the Ulzepdi.  Use
dual missiles on one of the
transports.  The last threat to
the Ulzepdi is the five additional
T-wings launched from [Tarrak's]
Cruiser.  Use your remaining missiles
on these starfighters.  Watch out
for the two T-wings [Notow], they
will target you.  Remember a single
advanced missile will destroy a
T-wing and two advanced missiles
will take out a transport.  Don't
hesitate to order your wingman to
help when needed.  Stay clear of
the TIE Defenders.  ÿ
