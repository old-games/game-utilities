// MISSION: 
>New Threats #6: Eliminate TIE Defender Factory
// NEXT
This mission designed for Peregrine Software by$>David Wessman 1994c
// NEXT
This mission will demand advanced assault tactics using the dual warhead armament of the Missile Boat.
// NEXT
The target is [Tarrak's] TIE Defender manufacturing facility, cargo containers and all craft in the area.
// NEXT
The facility's anti-warhead defense system is augmented with a large [Type C] minefield.
// NEXT
[Tarrak's] forces are loyal, well trained, and now very well equipped with TIE Defenders, T-wings and Y-wings. 
// NEXT
Admiral Thrawn will lead the attack personally from his flagship, the Imperial Star Destroyer [Grey Wolf].
// NEXT
TIE Interceptor groups [Alpha] and [Gamma] will engage the starfighter defenses and protect [Grey Wolf].
// NEXT
Missile Boat [Mu 1] will eliminate the factory's defenses to clear the way for TIE Bomber [Beta's] attack.

// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   To wipe out the deep space
manufacturing facility that [Tarrak]
has built for production of the
TIE Defender.  The Empire cannot
allow such a threat to exist, even
in the Outer Rim Territories.  You
will play a critical role in
penetrating the factory's
defenses to enable a rocket
attack by TIE Bombers.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly [Missile Boat Mu 1]
(MIS Mu 1) out of ISD [Grey Wolf].
T/I [Alpha] and [Gamma] have already
engaged the perimeter defense
fighters.  Once the T-wings have
been eliminated, the interceptors
will be in position to pounce on the
flight of Y-wings that are
preparing an attack on the [Grey
Wolf].
   For this mission your craft is
armed with a secondary load of [40
advanced concussion missiles] in
addition to the standard missile
load, a total load of [80 missiles]!
Also, you will have the new [improved
tractor beam].
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   The deep space manufacturing
facility you are going to attack
possesses defensive armament
consisting of [12 twin turbo lasers]
and an [advanced anti-warhead
system].  There are two arrays of
[Type C] mines, one above and one
below the factory.  These are
very nasty as they launch a
missile of their own when
destroyed.  Every time you take
one out, it will launch a missile at
you!
   There are also a half dozen [TIE
Defenders].  Though currently
inactive, they are being prepped
for combat and you can assume
that they will enter the battle
within moments.  You'll have to use
your overdrive if you want to
catch them unawares!
// NEXT

// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   [Tarrak] has attracted the
interest of Admiral Thrawn.  He
sees in her a resemblance to
himself.  Having convinced the
Emperor of her value, he has been
directed to capture her alive.  She
is going to be offered the
opportunity to serve the Emperor
as Thrawn does.
   When the factory's shields fail,
she will attempt to escape.  You
will need to assist GUN [Tau] in
stopping her craft.  You don't
have an ion cannon, but you can
reduce her ship's shields, making it
easier for GUN [Tau] to disable!
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What have we accomplished?
   We have destroyed [Tarrak's] TIE
Defender factory.  The threat of
proliferation of the TIE Defenders
has been greatly reduced.  Only
Zaarin retains the TIE Defender.
But Admiral Thrawn has developed
the trump card...the [Missile Boat],
(which you proved in the last
battle to be the ultimate
starfighter in the galaxy!)
   Congratulations on your
unsurpassed combat fighter
prowess.  You must join Thrawn in
the hunt for Zaarin.  Only the two
of you can make him feel the full
might of Imperial justice!
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Target ISD [Grey Wolf], the
factory and T/D [Red Devil 1], saving
each to a memory location.  Then
target Y-W [Gold Devil 1] and engage
the overdrive.  Redirect the beam
recharge to the engines.  Reset
the laser recharge rate to maximum
and head towards the targeted
Y-wing.
   Switch to missiles and select
dual fire mode.  Take out as many
Y-wings as you can in a single
pass.  [DO NOT] turn to engage any
you miss, continue towards the
factory.  Target T/D [Red Devil 1]
and select single fire mode.  When
you are in range, disengage the
overdrive and reset the shield
recharge rate to maximum.  Destroy
the T/Ds, then take out FAC/1's
warhead launcher (2 missiles.)
   Clear the mines using single
missiles from maximum range.
Launch at 2 or 3 mines, then
switch back to lasers and target
the incoming missile from the first
mine you destroyed.  Blast it with
your laser or evade it and any
other(s).  Repeat as rapidly as you
can to clear the mines quickly.

What did I accomplish?
   You enabled the capture of
the [Nami] leader [Tarrak].  The
Emperor will be very pleased.  He is
looking forward to meeting his new
servant.  You and Admiral Thrawn
will both be well rewarded well for
your outstanding service to the
Empire!
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Pay careful attention to the
status of the factory.  When its
shields fail, COR [Dhoora] will be
launched from it.  Use dual missiles
to quickly knock out the [Dhoora's]
shields.  Each missile takes out
about 20% so you'll need to use
[five missiles.] Gun [Tau] comes out of
hyperspace directly in the [Dhoora's]
path so if its shields are out
they should disable it on their
first pass.  TRN [Epsilon 1] will
launch from the [Grey Wolf] to
conduct the boarding and
capturing.  ÿ
