// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   To protect the [Red Claw] while a
pair of modified corvettes from
[Chemeti] squadron pick up the TIE
Defender research scientist and
prisoners captured during your
last mission.  Critical replacement
parts for the Interdictor's
hyperdrive are being delivered by
the corvettes as well.  The
scientist's safety is of paramount
importance, though, and you are to
ensure a safe transfer.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly [Assault Gunboat Mu
1] (GUN Mu 1).  For this mission your
craft is armed with the standard
load of [16 advanced concussion
missiles].  Also, you will have the
new, improved tractor beam.
   [Red Claw's] last six TIEs will be
on patrol and four more Gunboats
from [Tau] Squadron are due to
arrive soon.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   The [Rneekii Pirates] have all
been captured or killed, but
[Tarrak's] group may attempt a
rescue.  We've learned from our
captives that the pirates had also
negotiated with Zaarin for the
scientist's ransom.  This suggests
that Zaarin may have information
concerning the deal we made...maybe
even its location!  It is even
possible that the pirates may have
been planning some sort of
deception of their own involving
Admiral Zaarin!  We may not have
much time before he sends an
attack force to this location.  As
you well know, the greatest threat
would be from any TIE Defenders.
In such a circumstance, do your
best to protect the corvette
that is to pick up the scientist
and escort it to safety.

What have I accomplished?
   You succeeded in seeing the
scientist to safety.
Unfortunately, it was on the wrong
ship!  We were the victims of a
skillful deception that could only
have been accomplished by Zaarin
or his henchmen.  The strike force
you defeated must have been
intended primarily as a distraction.
In the heat of the battle, it kept
us from looking too closely at the
ship that took the scientist.
   Your role in saving the [Red
Claw] from destruction will probably
save you from the wrath of Lord
Vader.  The captain of the [Red
Claw] will not be so lucky.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Assign the [Red Claw] and [Chemeti
1] to memory locations.  When the
T/Ds arrive, target the nearest
starfighter attacking the corvette
(T/D Gamma.) Take out the entire
flight group using dual missiles
before they can launch torpedoes.
By the time you've got them all,
you will be under attack.  Eliminate
your attackers before proceeding
against any craft that are now
threatening the [Red Claw].
   Remember to use your tractor
beam when dogfighting the T/Ds.
To maintain the beam, its recharge
setting must be at maximum.  Turn
it on only when your target is in
front of you.  To maintain speed
and keep your shields up, redirect
shield recharge to the engines and
set cannon recharge to maximum.
Periodically tranfer power from
cannons to shields.
   Note that by using your
tractor beam on a craft that is
engaged in an attack run on a
capital ship, you can force it to
crash into the capital ship.
[Warning!] This will cause damage to
the capital ship!  ÿ
