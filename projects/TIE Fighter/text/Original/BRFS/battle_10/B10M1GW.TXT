// NEXT
>[This mission designed by David Wessman  1994c]
// NEXT
The [Rneekii Pirates] are ransoming the [T/D Scientist] to us at a rendezvous point near [Kiilimaar].
// NEXT
We have agreed to their conditions: an unarmed shuttle will exchange the ransom for the hostage.
// NEXT
We're permitted one starfighter escort and you have been selected.  You will fly Assault Gunboat [Mu 1].
// NEXT
The transfer has been worked out in detail.  At the moment it is concluded we have a surprise planned.
// NEXT
The Interdictor cruiser [Red Claw] will arrive precisely [90 seconds] after mission start to trap the pirates.
// NEXT
Your primary task will be to disable their transport, then destroy any fighters threatening the shuttle.
// NEXT
[Red Claw] will be accompanied by a pair of ATRs.  The cruiser will also launch its own fighters.
// NEXT
You will be exposed and alone at first and it will be your responsibility to safeguard Shuttle [Lambda 1].
// NEXT
You will receive the radio message, ["Full speed to Kiilimaar!"] as your signal to begin the attack.

// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   To recover the scientist who
led Zaarin's TIE Defender research
program.  As you know he was
captured by the [Rneekii Pirates]
using an ion cannon minefield.  They
sought to ransom the scientist to
the highest bidder.  Not
surprisingly, the Empire was the
highest bidder.  What will be a
surprise is our plan for the
pirates once the scientist is
secure aboard our shuttle!
   You will play a crucial role in
the coming mission.  It will be your
task to disable the pirates'
transport so the ransom may be
recovered.  Then you will escort
the shuttle to safety aboard the
Interdictor cruiser [Red Claw].
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly [Assault Gunboat Mu
1] (GUN Mu 1).  [90 seconds] after
you come out of hyperspace, the
Interdictor cruiser [Red Claw] will
arrive to trap the pirates.  [Red
Claw] will have six TIE Bombers and
six TIE Interceptors.  A pair of
Assault Transports ([Omega]) will
accompany the cruiser.
   For this mission your craft is
armed with the standard load of [16
advanced concussion missiles].  Also,
you will have the new, improved
tractor beam.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   The [Rneekii Pirates] are known
to operate at least one [Lorinar
class Strike Cruiser].  It is capable
of carrying one full squadron of
starfighters.  The starfighters
are [R-41 Starchasers], similar in
most respects to the [Z-95
Headhunter].  According to their
ransom demands, five R-41s will
escort the transport carrying the
scientist.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   This "crime lord" [Tarrak] is no
ordinary pirate.  She is the last
leader of a nomadic warrior people
known as the [Nami].  The [Nami] were
driven into the Outer Rim during
the Clone Wars and forgotten
about.  Their recent capture of
TIE Defender prototypes could
mean a resurgence of their power,
perhaps even an attempt to regain
their lost territories.
   Their ability to exploit the TIE
Defender technology is probably
minimal without the expertise to
actually build more.  However, they
are probably aware of the [Rneekii]
ransom offer and it is likely that
they will make an attempt to
capture the T/D Scientist.
   If this comes to pass, the
Emperor wishes that [Tarrak] be
taken prisoner.  You are to remain
alert to any opportunity to
capture any [Nami] ship she might be
aboard.

What have I accomplished?
   You have ensured the return
to the Empire of an extremely
valuable asset.  At the same time,
you played a major role in subduing
a renegade band of pirates.
Congratulations, that's what this
job is all about!
   Of mixed blessing was the
simultaneous trapping of a rival
pirate gang led by the crime lord
[Tarrak].  Her forces did some heavy
damage to the [Red Claw], taking out
the cruiser's hyperdrive.  The
Interdictor is stranded here until
a new hyperdrive can be delivered.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Position yourself behind the
R-41s and have a missile ready to
launch at their transport as soon
as the docking is completed.  You
may then take out some R-41s as
well, but be sure to disable the
transport before you get caught
up in a dogfight.
   You should have [SHU Lambda 1]
tagged to memory so you can
quickly determine who the nearest
threat is.  The [Rneekii] will respond
immediately to our trap and begin
launching additional R-41s.  It is
these newcomers who will go after
the shuttle.
   You should also remember that
your tractor beam is now strong
enough to "hold" an enemy craft
for your missiles to home in on.
Even if you are forced to break
your hold, you can reacquire it a
moment later.  If your missile is
still tracking, it won't have any
trouble catching the craft you've
"painted" with your beam.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What have I accomplished?
   Your quick response to the
arrival of the [Nami] raider group
ensured the capture of a Corellian
transport.  Unfortunately, [Tarrak]
was not on board.  The good news
is that several prisoners were
taken and interrogation should
reveal the location of their base.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   When the [Nami] raider group
arrives, assign COR [Choora] to a
memory location, then target the
nearest Y-wing.  Select missiles in
dual fire mode and destroy the
entire flight group as quickly as
you can.  Then recall the COR from
memory and disable it.  ATR Omega
will board and capture it.
   If you're too far from SHU
Lambda to prevent it being
disabled, don't panic.  Even if COR
[Choora] captures the T/D
Scientists, it can't escape the
grasp of the [Red Claw].  The
Y-wings are what you need to
worry about because after they've
disabled SHU [Lambda 1] to enable its
capture by COR [Choora], they will
make a heavy bomb attack on the
[Red Claw].  Only if they can
destroy the Interdictor will they
be able to escape.  ÿ
