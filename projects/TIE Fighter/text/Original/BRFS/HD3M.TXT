// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   A convoy of ships are going to
pass through your patrol area.
You are to inspect their cargoes.
Be on alert for Rebel weaponry
that may be concealed onboard.
If any illegal cargo is found, help
the Imperial transport that arrives
to disable and capture the ship.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly the new [TIE
Defender] designated [Alpha 1].  You
are the only ship in your flight
group.  Your craft will be armed
with [8] concussion missiles.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   We suspect that Rebel craft
may be nearby to come to the aid
of any Rebel ship that you may
discover.  Stay alert!

What have I accomplished?
   You have remained vigilant and
have discovered a Rebel attempt
to sneak their contraband past
you.  Excellent job.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   You will have to move fast to
inspect all freighters before they
reach their hyperspace points.
Avoid getting distracted by the
starfighter support.  Inspecting
the cargo vessels is your main
priority.  ÿ
