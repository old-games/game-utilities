// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   Your objective is to destroy
the Rebel spy probe in this sector.
When this is accomplished, return
to your command ship the Corvette
Astin.
// NEXT

only ship in your flight group.
Your craft will be armed with [4]
concussion missiles.

What have I accomplished?
   You have demonstrated how to
avoid Rebel spacecraft and
complete your mission.  Good work.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Remember that your primary goal
is to take out the probe.  Don't
get distracted by the Rebel
fighters.  Save one of your
missiles for the probe.  It can be
destroyed from long range.  When
under attack from enemy missiles,
turn as hard as you can.  Missiles
may be destroyed by laser fire!  ÿ
