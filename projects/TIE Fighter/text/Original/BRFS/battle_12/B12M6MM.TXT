// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   You will hyperjump into a region
where there is a large
congregation of Rebel starships.
Imperial Intelligence suspects that
this is a military summit where the
Rebels are preparing their forces
for an all-out attack on the
Empire.  To verify this, [Lord Vader]
has ordered a reconnaissance
flight into the area.  You must
inspect the capital ships gathered
there.  The Rebels believe they
have a golden opportunity to
strike at the heart of the Empire
before the second Death Star is
finished in the Endor system.  The
Death Star is actually fully
operational.  This attack is
precisely what the Emperor wishes
and is part of his carefully
crafted plan to draw all the Rebels
into a trap and finish them off.
The Rebels appear to have taken
the bait and are planning their
attack at this very moment.  [Lord
Vader] wants to know the makeup
of the Rebel force which will
indicate whether the Rebels have
been fully duped by the Emperor's
gambit.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly a [Missile Boat]
designated [Tau 1].  You will be the
only ship in your flight group.  For
this mission your craft has been
loaded with the standard armament
of [80 advanced concussion missiles].
Your craft will have the tractor
beam installed.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   You will encounter a large
contingent of Rebel craft of all
classifications.  The Rebel
starships have turbo lasers and
missiles, as well as starfighters.
A-wing interceptors will be your
greatest threat.  [Lord Vader] does
not want you to destroy too many
of their starfighters unless
necessary.  Your mission is
intelligence gathering, not assault.
Inflicting too much damage early on
might scare the Rebels away from
their attack at Endor.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   Our intelligence network has
informed [Lord Vader] of a potential
problem.  There is a Bothan
computer expert who is suspicious
of the information uncovered from
the stolen freighter.  It is
imperative that he does not get a
chance to voice his theory.
Imperial Intelligence suspects that
this doubting expert is onboard an
escort shuttle headed for the
Rebel military summit.  To guarantee
the Emperor's plan, seek out and
destroy the Bothan craft carrying
the computer programmer.  The
[Emperor] wants nothing to interfere
with his grand plan.
// NEXT

// SKIP
What did we accomplish?
   Your inspection of the Rebel
capital ships informed [Lord Vader]
of those present and their
intentions.  This group of ships
definitely carried some Rebel strike
force commanders.  This fact
confirms that the Rebels have
taken the bait!  The Emperor's plan
to lure the entire Rebel force to
one place and spring a trap to
finish them off once and for all is
proceeding well.  The glorious
Imperial Fleet is gathering its
forces near Endor and soon will be
ready for the Rebel attack.  The
Garrett's forces must delay the
Rebels until all Imperial forces are
in place.  The Rebels realize their
location has been exposed, so
they are relocating their forces
to Sullust.  An interception mission
is already in the planning stages.
Report to the briefing area
immediately where you'll be briefed
on how we plan to stop some of
the Rebel fleet from joining up at
Sullust.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Engage and destroy the
starfighters present at the start
of the mission.  Then build up your
shields and lasers completely
before inspecting the four capital
ships.  Use your overdrive
boosters to quickly travel the
distance between the capital ships
while inspecting them.

What did I accomplish?
   By destroying the shuttle
carrying the Bothan computer
programmer, you have secured the
secret that the data about the
second Death Star was a ruse.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   As soon as the Bothan escort
shuttles enter the area use your
SLAM boosters to intercept them.
Fire two advanced missiles at each
and follow up with a few laser
blasts.  ÿ
