// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   In addition to capturing the
Bothan space station, at least
[75%] of the Bothan craft near the
planet [Kothlis] must be destroyed.
This Bothan station [Kothlis II]
allowed the hijacked Imperial
freighter to dock and take on
supplies shortly after it was
captured.  Information could have
been removed from the freighter
and may still be onboard this
station.  Our forces must confirm
the presence of any Imperial data
or equipment before destroying
[Kothlis II].  The Bothans have
displayed great foolishness in
bringing the stolen Imperial
freighter to an installation so
close to one of their colonies.
Imperial forces will track down the
Bothans involved and eliminate them.
They must learn it is unwise to
oppose the [Emperor].
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly a [Missile Boat]
designated [Tau 1].  You will lead the
two ships in your flight group.
For this mission your craft has
been loaded with the standard
armament of [80 advanced missiles].
Use your missiles sparingly.  Your
craft will have the tractor beam
installed.  Use your beam weapon
to help acquire a missile lock on
the more maneuverable enemy
starfighters like the A-wings.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   The [Bothans] are using [Rebel]
type starfighters.  X-wings along
with a few A-wings are their best
craft.  Their pilots are well
trained, so don't underestimate
them.  Be alert for Rebel
reinforcements arriving to help
their ill-fated comrades.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   The [Emperor] has communicated
to me under the strictest of
confidences that the recovery of
the stolen freighter is not as
important as gathering information
about it.  It is too soon to
divulge anything more about this
highly sensitive matter.  There's a
Bothan corvette that is docking
with the space station.  Inspect
its cargo.  There's no need to
destroy the corvette, [Lord Vader]
just wants to confirm its
contents.  If the contents are
what [Lord Vader] suspects, it is
best to let the corvette escape
from the area safely.  Don't
question why, just follow the
Emperor's bidding.

What did we accomplish?
   Our forces crushed the [Bothan]
military force in the area of
[Kothlis II].  The success of this
engagement should reinforce the
fact that resistance to the
Emperor is futile.  The station was
boarded and searched by our
forces for any remnants of the
seized Imperial freighter.  The
stolen freighter was carrying
classified data on the readiness
of the Empire's new master weapon,
a newly designed Death Star.
Searching the station has revealed
the Bothan's intentions to
decipher and hand over the
technical data acquired from the
stolen freighter's databases to
the Rebels.  The Bothans must be
pursued to stop this treachery.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Order your wingman to attack
an incoming A-wing, then go after
the X-wings using dual missiles.
Destroy all the X-wings and
Y-wings immediately.  Concentrate
on defending the [Garrett].
// NEXT

What did I accomplish?
   You have discovered a valuable
piece of the Bothan puzzle.  Your
efforts are of great value to the
[Emperor].  The corvette's cargo of
specialized code breaking computers
proves they are trying to decipher
the top secret data onboard the
freighter.  This knowledge, along
with material collected from the
station, indicates the Bothans on
the verge of unlocking the
mysteries that the stolen
freighter contained.  The [Emperor]
is aware of your loyal work.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   After destroying the first
wave of [X-wings] use the missile
boat's overdrive boosters to
inspect the Bothan [corvette].  Get
right back to dogfighting
starfighters.  If you choose to
destroy the corvette, attack it
with warheads while remaining
outside its laser range.  ÿ
