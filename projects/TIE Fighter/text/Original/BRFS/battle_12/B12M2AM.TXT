// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   You must guarantee that the
transport [Sigma 1] makes it safely
back to the [Garrett] with the
Rebel and Bothan prisoners.  You
were successful in escorting the
Dargon safely into hyperspace so
it could deliver the prisoners to
the Garrett.  Unfortunately, when
the Dargon came out of
hyperspace it experienced engine
failure.  Sabotage is suspected.
[Lord Vader] has commanded that
the load of prisoners be
transferred to the Garrett
immediately because repairs to the
Dargon's engines will take too long.
The Rebels have already made one
unsuccessful attempt to rescue
their comrades.  You must ensure
that all the prisoners are
incarcerated onboard the Garrett.
Do not fail [Lord Vader].
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly a [TIE Advanced]
designated [Alpha 1].  You will lead
the three ships in your flight
group.  For this mission your craft
has been loaded with the standard
armament of [8 advanced
concussion missiles].
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   The [Rebels] are likely to try
another rescue attempt.  They will
likely get help from the Bothans.
Their attempt must prove futile or
you will be held accountable.

What did we accomplish?
   Imperial forces stopped the
[Rebels] from their second assault
and rescue operation.  Your role in
the success of this operation was
essential.  [Lord Vader] is
interrogating the seditious Rebel
and Bothan leaders at this moment.
Soon [Lord Vader] should know more
about the recent capture of an
Imperial freighter.  It is suspected
that this freighter was carrying
secret technical data and had
clearance codes to travel
throughout the Empire.  Reports
about the freighter's assault and
capture are incomplete and unclear
to us at this time.  When Imperial
Intelligence discovers the
whereabouts of this freighter, it
must be retrieved at all costs.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Transfer all laser energy to
the shields and turn off the
laser's recharge rate.  Head
straight towards the dreadnought
at high speed.  When the Rebel
frigate enters the area, put your
lasers on full recharge.  Order
your wingmen to attack the
A-wings when they appear.  Go
after the [Y-wings] yourself when
they launch, they're your [priority]
targets.  Use dual advanced
missiles on one Y-wing in each of
the three Y-wing flight groups.
Order your wingmen to help attack
Y-wings if needed.  ÿ
