// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   The [Bothan] dreadnought must
be destroyed and the Rebel
Calamari cruiser must be captured.
To accomplish this, our forces
must first destroy the Rebel
starfighters that are guarding
their rendezvous.  [Lord Vader]
believes that the Bothans have
had the time to decipher the
classified data from the Imperial
freighter and are passing this
information on to the Rebels.  The
Bothans and the Rebels are risking
much by having a meeting in this
well traveled part of space.  The
Bothans are not masters of
deception as their reputation
claims, in fact, this will be their
downfall.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly a [Missile Boat]
designated [Tau 1].  You will lead the
two ships in your flight group.
For this mission your craft has
been loaded with the standard
armament of [40 advanced missiles]
plus a load of [30 advanced
torpedoes].  Your craft will have
the tractor beam installed.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   The [Bothans] have only brought
a Dreadnought to the rendezvous
location but the [Rebels] have a
Calamari cruiser that can carry
several flight groups of
starfighters.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   [Lord Vader] demands the
apprehension of as many [Rebel]
prisoners as possible.  Help in the
capture of all the Rebel starships.
Our technicians will learn much from
their ships and equipment while
[Lord Vader] will glean much from its
crew.  It is important that [Lord
Vader] learns exactly what the
Rebels believe to be true about
the freighter's classified data.

// SKIP
What did we accomplish?
   The Garrett's forces destroyed
the [Bothans] before they could
escape.  In addition, our forces
were able to capture a fully
staffed [Rebel] cruiser.  The
cruiser's personnel have been
secured in the prisoner detention
cells aboard the [Garrett] awaiting
[Lord Vader's] examination.  Our
forces are closer to recovering
the missing freighter and its
valuable databases.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Take out four or so mines on
the first pass.  Order your
wingman to attack an [A-wing] and
go after one yourself using dual
advanced missiles.  Destroy all the
A-wings, [Z-95s] and [X-wings].  Then
take out the rest of the mines
before the assault transports
enter the area, 3 minutes after
the start of the mission.  Next,
help the assault transports
attack the cruiser.  Fire ten
advanced torpedoes into the
cruiser, then the rest into the
dreadnought.  Finish off the
dreadnought before the cruiser
gets disabled.  Deal with
starfighters whenever they
appear, then get back to the
starships.

What did I accomplish?
   You helped the Garrett's
forces swell the number of [Rebel]
prisoners captured recently.
These new prisoners will enable
[Lord Vader] to obtain a clear
picture of what the Rebels believe
to be true about the data that
was given to them by the Bothans.
It can now be revealed that the
data the Bothans have decoded
contains detailed technical data on
the Empire's new Death Star.  It
also included the location of the
construction site in the Endor
System as well as the new Death
Star's operational status.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   After attacking the [Bothan]
dreadnought and the [Rebel] cruiser,
use your SLAM to rendezvous with
the reload transport.  A Rebel
frigate enters soon after the
cruiser gets disabled, attack it
with a full payload of warheads so
Assault Transport [Omega 5] can
easily disable and capture it.  ÿ
