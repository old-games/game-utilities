// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   Imperial forces from the Star
Destroyer Garrett must ensure
that the [Dreadnought Dargon]
reaches its hyperspace jump point
at Darg 3.  You are to relieve the
pilots escorting it.  The Dargon is
carrying important prisoners that
[Lord Vader] has requested be
brought here for interrogation.
High ranking [Rebel] and [Bothan]
officers are listed on the prisoner
chart.  [Lord Vader] is interested in
these prisoners' possible
involvement in the recent theft of
an Imperial freighter near
Coruscant.  You must ensure the
safety of the Dargon.  [Lord Vader]
will not accept the escape or
rescue of these prisoners.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly a [TIE Advanced]
designated [Alpha 1].  You will lead
the three ships in your flight
group.  For this mission your craft
has been loaded with the standard
armament of [8 advanced
concussion missiles].  You have been
stationed onboard the [ISD Garrett].
[Lord Vader] is commanding the
Garrett and has specifically
requested your assignment to this
operation.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   Imperial Intelligence does not
expect trouble, but, as always, be
ready for any surprises that may
occur.  Recently, a few [Rebel]
scouts have been spotted in the
area.  Also, the Bothans have good
reason to want their people back.

What did we accomplish?
   The Dargon, her crew, and her
cargo of prisoners were all saved
from capture by the Rebels.
There is good reason to believe
that this group of prisoners was
involved in a recent hijacking of
one of our freighters.  They were
caught heading away from
Coruscant just after the attack
on the missing freighter.
   [Lord Vader] is still awaiting the
arrival of these prisoners.  The
Dargon has experienced engine
failure upon exiting hyperspace for
its rendezvous with Garrett.  It's
a little more than twenty-three
kilometers away.  You need to help
secure the transport of the
prisoners from the Dargon back to
the Garrett.  [Lord Vader] is
impatient about any further delay.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Order your wingman to attack
an [A-wing] when they enter the
area.  Hold back a little, then go
after a different A-wing with dual
missiles.  As soon as your two
missiles are launched, target the
[X-wings] and fire more missiles at
them.  Then, use your lasers to
destroy the [B-wings].  Try to
destroy as many torpedoes as you
can using your lasers.  If you
stop most of the warheads
launched at the [Dargon] it should
survive.  ÿ
