// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   The [Emperor] has ordered us to
delay the Rebel assault on the new
Death Star.  To accomplish this,
[Lord Vader] has ordered a
starfighter force to intercept and
destroy the first three Rebel
starships passing through the
hyperjump point [Sul-34].  [Lord
Vader] is confident that if the
lead ships are destroyed then the
Rebels will delay their attack until
they reinforce their fleet to
sufficient battle strength.  The
Rebels hope to destroy the [Death
Star] along with the [Emperor].
Instead, their attack will ultimately
seal their fate.  The majority of
the Imperial Navy under the
personal direction of the [Emperor]
is lying in wait to crush the Rebels
when they arrive at Endor.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly a [Missile Boat]
designated [Tau 1].  You will lead the
four ships in your flight group.
For this mission your craft has
been loaded with the standard
armament of [40 advanced missiles]
plus a load of [10 space bombs].
Your craft will have the tractor
beam installed.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   The upstart [Rebels] will be
moving a large contingent of
starships through this area on
their way to Sullust.  These
starships are part of the growing
Rebel Fleet gathering for the
upcoming attack on Endor.  The
Garrett's forces must engage and
delay the arrival of these ships to
[Sullust].  The starships will be
stocked with their full complement
of starfighters.  These
starfighters pose the greatest
threat to your mission success
and survival.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   Destroy a good number of the
Rebels' starfighters.  The [Emperor]
has ordered this preliminary action
to whittle down their starfighter
strength.  Then the Rebels will be
forced to commit all of their
reinforcement units in the upcoming
conflict.  The [Emperor] wants to
ensure that the Rebels will have
nothing left in reserve after the
battle at [Endor].
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What did we accomplish?
   The Garrett's forces destroyed
many Rebel starships as well as
starfighters.  This delayed the
Rebels from collecting all of their
front line forces, which will hamper
their overall success.  [Lord Vader]
will join the [Emperor] shortly to
observe the Rebels' defeat at
[Endor].  [Lord Vader] has
acknowledged your great skill and
loyalty as a value to the [Empire],
and has requested to be updated
on the progress of your career.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   As soon as the Rebel [Strike
Cruiser] enters the area, target it
and put it into the F5 memory
slot.  Tell your wingmen to attack
it while you use your overdrive to
intercept the [X-wings].  Your
wingmen need to release a whole
salvo of bombs before they are
intercepted by X-wings or A-wings.
As soon as they release their
bombs, order them to engage the
nearest starfighter.  Save your
bombs for later to use on the
[light Calamari cruiser] and [Carrack
cruiser] or the two [modified
frigates].  Switch to dual advanced
missiles and target the nearest
craft.  It will be X-wing Red 1.
Take out X-wing group Red on the
first pass, then target an A-wing.
Use the tractor beam on the
A-wings along with dual missiles.
You'll have time to destroy the
starships.  They have some
distance to travel before they
reach their hyperjump point.  You
may wish to go for a warhead
reload once the Rebel starfighters
have been crushed.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What did I accomplish?
   You have given the [Emperor]
the extra time needed to get to
Endor and prepare for the Rebel
Alliance's extermination.  The Rebels
will have to resupply their lead
units from their reserve
starfighter squadrons, thereby
committing all of their forces to
the battle.  Thus the victory at
Endor should be total.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   If you haven't received the
"Secondary goals complete"
message by the time the primary
goal is completed, be patient, as
more enemy starfighters are bound
to show up shortly.  ÿ
