// MISSION: 
>Prelude to Endor, Mission #3: Attack at Bothuwui
// NEXT
Not long ago the [Bothans] captured an Imperial freighter that was carrying classified cargo.
// NEXT
To obtain news about this missing freighter, our forces are going to capture some of their ships. 
// NEXT
Gunboats [Tau] will disable the transports, then provide cover over the capture operation.
// NEXT
Once a transport is disabled, the [Garrett] will enter and launch assault transports [Omega] to capture it.
// NEXT
This mission was created by [David Maxwell]$for [Totally Games] 1995.
// NEXT
Gunboats [Mu] will escort Gunboats [Tau] against the Bothans.

// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   You must disable the three
Bothan transports and provide
cover for assault transports
Omega during their capture
operation.  [Imperial] scouts located
this group of three transports
taking on cargo.  Not long ago,
the [Bothans], known to be
sympathetic to the Rebels,
attacked and captured an [Imperial]
freighter carrying top secret
information in its computers.  This
information is important enough
that the [Emperor] has assigned
[Lord Vader] to personally
investigate the incident.  At
present, Imperial Intelligence
doesn't know where the Bothans
have hidden the freighter.  Imperial
forces are going to attack the
[Bothans] along all of their known
trade routes and bases in hopes
of gathering information on the
missing freighter.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly a [Gunboat]
designated [Tau 1].  You will lead the
two ships in your flight group.
For this mission your craft has
been loaded with the standard
armament of [8 advanced proton
torpedoes].
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   The [Bothans] have acquired
various technologies, most of it
from the [Rebels].  Therefore,
expect [Rebel] type starfighters to
defend their transports.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   The [Emperor] wants any and all
information on the [Bothans].  The
Bothans are noted for their
extensive spy network and have
foolishly allied themselves with the
Rebels.  Until now, the Bothans
have not been a serious threat to
the Empire.  They attracted the
[Emperor's] attention when they
captured one of our freighters.
This Imperial freighter was carrying
encrypted data files concerning a
top secret Imperial weapons
program.  Imperial Intelligence
believes that the Bothan computer
specialists are capable of decoding
the data, but it will take them
some time.

// SKIP
What did we accomplish?
   Imperial forces captured three
of the [Bothans'] transports along
with their crews.  [Lord Vader] is
currently interrogating these new
prisoners.  Imperial technicians are
scouring the transports for clues
as to the whereabouts of the
stolen freighter.  The ships'
onboard computers are being
closely scrutinized and our
analysts are reviewing the ships'
logs.  [Lord Vader] has already
learned that the stolen freighter
was taken to the Bothan space
installation near Kothlis.  He is
certain the Empire will know all the
[Bothan's] secrets shortly.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Order your wingman to attack
[Botani 1].  Then fire two torpedoes
each at [Botani 2] and [Botani 3].
Destroy any X-wings that maneuver
into your line of fire and use a
single torpedo at point blank
range.  Don't waste time, as the
Bothan transports will try to
escape as soon as Imperial forces
arrive.  When disabling the
transports, approach them from
below so the containers block their
bottom turret and the top turret
cannot get a clear shot at your
craft.

// SKIP
What did I accomplish?
   You helped capture a [Bothan
commander] for interrogation.  He
should have more valuable
information than the rest of the
Bothan rabble.  It has been noted
that you performed above and
beyond your regular mission
assignment.  Any intelligence
gathered by [Lord Vader] will go
straight to the [Emperor].  We
cannot tell you more at this time,
except everything is not as it
seems.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Let no craft escape.  Hurry to
disable the escort shuttle [Com 1]
before it leaves the area with the
Bothan commander.  Fire one
torpedo at it to lower its shields.
