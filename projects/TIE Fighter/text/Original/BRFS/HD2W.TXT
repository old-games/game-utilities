// MISSION: 
>TIE Defender Combat #2: Tractor Beam
// NEXT
This mission designed for Peregrine Software, Inc. by >David Wessman  1994c
// NEXT
We have tracked a Rebel spy to this salvage yard near [Venzeiia 2 Prime].  The spy must be taken alive!
// NEXT
The individual we want is flying a [YT-1300 Corellian Transport] that has been modified for extra speed.
// NEXT
Since it's capable of outrunning our Gunboats, a TIE Defender will be necessary to catch it.
// NEXT
Your primary objective is to intercept and disable any [Corellian Transports] in the area.
// NEXT
Six TIE Advanced will support you.  They will destroy any opposition and then attack the platform.
// NEXT
Assault Transport group [Sigma] will stand by ready to board and capture any craft that are disabled.
// NEXT
For harboring fugitives, the station will be seized.  [ISD Glory] will arrive to oversee its capture.
// NEXT
Your secondary objective is to assist this effort in any way you can (shield reduction, area patrol, etc.)
// NEXT
Prisoners and captured vessels will be taken aboard the [Glory] for "processing".  
// NEXT
Remain alert at all times to the unexpected opportunity.  Be prepared to follow new orders.

// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   To practice using a [tractor
beam].  A tractor beam is a
controlled force field that can be
used to reduce a target ship's
mobility.  This allows your craft's
other offensive weaponry to be
used more effectively.  Whether
you are trying to destroy or
disable the enemy craft, the
tractor beam will make your job
easier.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly the [TIE Defender]
designated [Delta 1].  For this
mission your ship will be equipped
with a [tractor beam emitter], as
well as the standard load of [8]
advanced concussion missiles.
   The tractor beam uses a lot of
power.  This power has to come
either from your engines, cannons,
or shields; so finding the optimal
balance for a particular
circumstance may prove quite a
challenge.  The beam emitter's
range is approximately 1.5
kilometers.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   The main threat you will face is
the platform's gun batteries.  Stay
out of range while your [TIE
Advanced] escorts attack the
platform.  They will flush out your
quarry if it doesn't attempt to
flee at first sight of you.
   The [Corellian Transports] you
must disable are very fast.  You
will need to be careful with your
energy management to catch them.
   There are some [A-wings] to be
wary of, but your escorts should
take care of them.

What have I accomplished?
   You have demonstrated the
ability to use the incredible power
of the TIE Defender in the service
of your Emperor!
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   The Corellian Transports
attempt their escapes one at a
time, but right after one another
so you must move quickly to catch
them all in time.  Try weakening
their shields with missiles as you
close in, (each warhead will take
out about 20%.)
   Once you are within range for
your ion cannons, (about 0.8
kilometers) try the following energy
balance:  tractor beam recharge at
[maximum], cannon recharge at
[increased] rate and maintain shields
at [normal] recharge.  ÿ
