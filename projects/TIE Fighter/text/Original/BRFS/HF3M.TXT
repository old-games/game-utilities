// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   Your objective is to attack and
destroy a Rebel outpost of
containers, A-wings, X-wings and
tugs.  There are many craft to
destroy so you must work quickly.
One approach is to attack the
A-wings first with your missiles,
since they are the hardest to
catch once they start moving.
Then, you can go after the tugs
before they finish docking with the
other starfighters.  Leave the
containers for last.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly a [TIE Fighter]
designated [Alpha 1].  You will be the
only Imperial craft on this mission.
Your craft will be armed with [4]
concussion missiles.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   No defending enemy forces are
expected.  The Rebel outpost
appears to be unguarded.

What have I accomplished?
   You have shown a superb ability
to destroy enemy forces quickly.
Well done.  Raids like this one are
essential for depleting the Rebels'
war supplies.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Avoid tight turns and high
speeds in dangerous areas like the
dense concentration of craft of
this Rebel outpost.  Lowering your
speed gives you more time to fire
at targets and to avoid obstacles.
