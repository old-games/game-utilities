// COMPLETION MESSAGES:
Great going, Mu 1! The convoy has escaped to safety!
Now kill what traitor forces you can before they flee!
Very good, Mu 1. Intel will need to analyze your sensor data
And without any ATRs, Zaarin can not capture any CTRNs!
The Missile Boats have been lost and Zaarin is still free
Our forces are in serious trouble, Mu 1. Return at once!

// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   Grand Admiral Thrawn's plans are
in jeopardy due to the unexpected
attack by Zaarin's forces.  The
coordination of our forces has
been disrupted and now the
convoy carrying our new missile
boats is at risk.
   Your highest priority is to save
the convoy.  In order for them to
make it safely into hyperspace,
you will have to protect them from
harm for about [seven] minutes.
Thrawn's strike force is on the
way, but only you and your Missile
Boat can reach the convoy in time
to prevent its loss.
   Destroy at least half of
Zaarin's forces.  The heavy losses
we have inflicted on the traitors
are beginning to make a difference.
When this is over, these criminals
will be just another bad memory!
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly [Missile Boat Mu 1]
(MIS Mu 1) out of Imperial Star
Destroyer [Grey Wolf] under the
command of Admiral Thrawn.  With
the standard load of [40 advanced
concussion missiles] your craft will
also have [30 advanced proton
torpedoes] in case anything heavy
shows up.  Your craft is fitted
with the [tractor beam].
   The convoy consists of three
Container Transports and four
Escort Shuttles.  The Imperial Star
Destroyers [Grey Wolf] and
[Resolution] will arrive in minutes, but
for now you are our only hope!
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   There is a squadron of twelve
Assault Gunboats and a flight
group of four TIE Defenders.  This
may just be the advance wave so
be alert and prepared for new
threats!
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   If any of the convoy ships
become disabled, you must prevent
them from being captured.  Watch
for the arrival of enemy
transports and destroy them.  If
any enemy starships arrive, get
close enough to do a short range
sensor scan, but don't worry
about destroying them.  Our two
Star Destroyers will take care of
that!
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What have we accomplished?
   We destroyed quite a number of
enemy starfighters and prevented
the capture of any missile boats
from the convoy.  For the traitors
the loss of so many craft,
especially the TIE Defenders, has
to be devastating.  Still, Zaarin
was very successful in concealing
the extent of his preparations
and he may have a few surprises
left.
   The missile boats you protected
will be delivered to a training
facility where a cadre of elite
pilots such as yourself will form a
new unit.  Just think of the
possibilities when several missile
boats are fighting together!
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Kill the Assault Gunboats as
quickly as you can.  Use your
SLAMs to get in range and destroy
them with a single advanced
torpedo.  If any of them get by
you to disable a container
transport, be sure to destroy any
enemy craft which attempt to
board the disabled ship.  (When it
is safe enough for them to enter,
there are Shuttles standing by to
deliver repair crews if needed.)
   When all the Assault Gunboats
are destroyed and no friendly
ships are at risk of capture, take
out the TIE Defenders.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What have I accomplished?
   You destroyed Zaarin's Assault
Transports and prevented the
capture of any Container
Transports.  Also, you were able to
get short range sensor scans on
Zaarin's flagship and its two
escorting starships.  The data will
be analyzed for clues that might
reveal weaknesses to exploit.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Try to inspect the [Glory] and
its two escorts soon after they
arrive, while they're still in close
formation.  If you've been
successful in sweeping the area of
enemy fighters, you won't have any
trouble eliminating the Assault
Transports.  ÿ
