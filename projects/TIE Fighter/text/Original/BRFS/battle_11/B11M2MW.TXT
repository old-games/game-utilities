// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   To destroy a refitting base
that former Admiral Zaarin is using
as a "marshaling area." Captain
Kuuztin believes we have an
excellent chance of catching
Zaarin off guard and has directed
that we prepare to attack
immediately!
   Your role will be to lead the
attack by eliminating any fighter
opposition as well as clearing any
static defenses (mines) in the
area.  You will deploy from ISD
[Courageous].
   Remember that the definition of
"freighter" craft includes cargo
vessels and cargo containers.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly [Missile Boat Mu 1]
(MIS Mu 1) out of ISD [Courageous].
In addition to the standard load
of [40 advanced concussion missiles],
your craft's secondary armament
has been loaded with [10 heavy
space bombs].
   Also, your craft has been
fitted with a [jamming beam].  Use it
to disrupt the fire control
systems of the platform and
enemy capital ships.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   Zaarin still commands large
forces and this platform is sure
to be well defended.  We're certain
the Interdictor Cruiser [Bomb] and
its attendant flotilla of Frigates
will be in the area, but there may
be any variety of other craft
present.
   If there are enemy TIE
Defenders, ISD [Courageous] will hold
off deployment of her TIE Fighters
and Bombers as they wouldn't last
long against such opposition.  Your
top priority then will be to take
out any Defenders as quickly as
possible.
   Any cargo vessels and
containers should be eliminated as
opportunities present themselves.
They may not be much of a
threat, but you never know what
critical cargo may be destined to
give us grief later!
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   Captain Kuuztin believes the
information extracted from our
latest prisoners is so good that
he has decided to risk going ahead
with the attack without notifying
Grand Admiral Thrawn.  He is
gambling that his audacity will lead
to promotion, possibly even
replacing Admiral Thrawn!
   Stay alert for any traps and
remember, the missile boat you are
flying is possibly as valuable as
Captain Kuuztin's Star Destroyer!
DO NOT ALLOW YOUR SHIP TO FALL
INTO ENEMY HANDS!
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What have we accomplished?
   You participated in an
ill-advised attempt at a
pre-emptive strike that ended in
disaster for your commanding
officer, Captain Kuuztin.  Luckily,
you avoided capture in the ensuing
ambush.  Also, you can claim
responsibility for the destruction
of a great number of enemy
forces.
   On balance, losses were roughly
equal, but Zaarin can afford them
less.  In this sense we came out
ahead, but let's not have any more
"victories" like this one, okay?
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Target INT Bomb's warhead
launcher and fire two pairs of
missiles to destroy it.  Then
target HLF SBT 1 and destroy with
a single missile.  Now take out the
two TUGs.  This is to prevent
these utility vehicles from moving
any of the cargo containers to
safety.  You can then destroy
the containers as opportunities
present themselves.  (Note that
the containers are considered
"freighters" and are included in
the goal of destroying 50% of all
freighters.)
   Check T/B Beta's status and
join their attack.  Be sure to
engage your jamming beam as soon
as you are in range (1.5-2.0
kilometers.) Continue to assist your
TIE Bombers, but don't forget
about the minefield!  There are
only eight mines, but the sooner
you eliminate them the better.
   When the Platform finally
becomes the target, be sure to
destroy its warhead launcher early.
Don't try to save ISD Courageous
if you haven't achieved your
primary goals.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What have I accomplished?
   You discovered the presence of
several large and expensive items
of stolen Imperial military hardware
before assisting our forces in
their destruction!  This will further
erode Zaarin's ability to conduct
offensive operations.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   When you are taking out the
utility vehicles, make your
inspection passes of the Platform
and cargo containers.  Don't
overlook the Shuttle parked on the
Platform.
   A neutral Bulk Freighter drops
out of hyperspace to deliver
another cargo container shortly
after you get your primary goals.
Make an inspection pass as quickly
as you can before your comrades
destroy them.  ÿ
