>Hunt for Zaarin, Mission #1: Intercept Convoy
// NEXT
>[This mission designed by David Wessman  1995c]
// NEXT
A supply convoy has been detected heading into the area where we suspect the traitor Zaarin is lurking.
// NEXT
Protected by an old Dreadnought, the convoy seems to be waiting for a rendezvous with Zaarin's forces.
// NEXT
GUN [Tau] has been sent to interrupt any cargo operations and hold the attention of enemy fighters.
// NEXT
Missile Boat [Mu 1] will join GUN [Tau] as quickly as possible. Together they will clear all enemy fighters.
// NEXT
[Mu 1] will then inspect the convoy and destroy the Dreadnought with a heavy rocket attack.
// NEXT
If the freighters are carrying any weapons or military supplies, they should be captured.
// NEXT
If Zaarin's forces show, ISD [Courageous] will join the battle to defeat them and oversee capture ops. 
// NEXT
All starfighter pilots will do their utmost to ensure the successful completion of this mission!

// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   To intercept a convoy
detected in the area where former
Admiral Zaarin was last headed.
Destroy all enemy combatants.
Capture any freighters bearing
useful military supplies.
   The Emperor has directed Grand
Admiral Thrawn to locate Zaarin and
eliminate him!  Zaarin hopes to
elude justice by escaping into the
Unknown Regions.  If he is
successful, he will attempt to mass
new forces for another attack on
the Emperor.  This must be
prevented!
   Due to your enormous skill so
far displayed, you have been
personally selected by Admiral
Thrawn to receive the toughest
assignments.  Whenever our probe
and reconnaissance efforts turn
up anything useful, you will
immediately lead an attack into the
area.
   For this operation you will be
under the command of Captain
Kuuztin, another hand-picked
officer known for his bravery.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will continue to fly the
Missile Boat thanks to your
outstanding performance during
your last tour of duty.  Your
craft remains [Missile Boat Mu 1]
(MIS Mu 1) and you are currently
assigned to ISD [Courageous].
   In addition to the standard
load of [40 advanced concussion
missiles], your craft's secondary
armament has been loaded with [20
heavy rockets].  Additionally, your
craft has a [tractor beam].
   Remember, the Missile Boat is
still considered experimental.  Were
it not for the dire circumstances
surrounding Zaarin's coup attempt,
this new weapon would not be
risked in combat so soon!  [DO NOT
ALLOW YOUR CRAFT TO FALL INTO
ENEMY HANDS!!]
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   The enemy convoy consists of
three bulk freighters protected by
an old Dreadnought and several
T-wings.  Former Admiral Zaarin still
commands a large number of
vessels of several types and may
send any number of them to the
rendezvous.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   Admiral Thrawn needs to locate
Zaarin quickly.  If this convoy is
headed for Zaarin, there may be
an opportunity to capture a ship
whose navigation data may reveal
his location.  GUN [Nu] will be
dispatched to disable any such
craft.
   Despite your lack of an ion
cannon, you can still assist any
capture attempts by helping to
take out the target's shields.  But
you must also protect the ion
cannon equipped Gunboats.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What have we accomplished?
   Our operation was a success.
Many enemy craft were destroyed
and valuable military supplies were
recovered.  The traitor will soon
begin to face a shortfall of vital
resources.  This may prove critical
in the battle ahead!  Hopefully,
Zaarin will become more desperate
and make a fatal mistake.  Admiral
Thrawn intends to be ready when
he does.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Engage the SLAMs immediately
and then launch [12 rockets] at the
Dreadnought.  As soon as the
rockets are fired, switch to
missiles and take out the T-wings.
You must be very quick about this!
It's possible to swing in behind T-W
[Inrider] and destroy them all in time
to save GUN [Tau 2].
   Don't forget about the
freighters!  Make an inspection
pass and put a single rocket into
each one to reduce its shields.
By this time you will be under
attack by TIE Interceptors coming
from Zaarin's M/FRG [Strident].
Ignore them for now and go after
the frigate with the rest of your
rockets.
   ISD [Courageous] should arrive
while this is going on and it will
start launching TIE Fighters and
Bombers as well.  Together with the
bombers you will be able to take
out the frigate.  After that, just
mop up, but don't forget to cover
the capture operations!
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What have I accomplished?
   You assisted in the capture of
a shuttle that may lead us to
Zaarin.  The interrogation of the
crew and analysis of its navigation
computer's data will begin
immediately.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   The shuttle will try to dock
with each of the freighters, so
you can wait until it has completed
these operations before worrying
about it.  The friendly Assault
Gunboats will try to disable it, and
you can assist them by taking
down the shuttle's shields for
them.  Be careful you don't
destroy it, though!
   If neither GUN Tau nor GUN Nu
are successful disabling the enemy
craft we're trying to capture, you
will have to call for reinforcements.
GUN [Rho] will then arrive to make
another attempt.  ÿ
