// NEXT
>[This mission designed by David Wessman  1995c]
// NEXT
The secrecy of the [Vorknkx Project] has been compromised. The site must be evacuated.
// NEXT
Already Zaarin has sent another attack force consisting of several Carrack Cruisers and ATRs.
// NEXT
No fighters have entered the battle yet. Perhaps Zaarin's losses are finally making a difference?
// NEXT
Missile Boat [Mu 1] will join T/I [Gamma] and T/B [Theta] in covering the evacuation. Destroy all enemy craft!

// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   Our two Platforms have taken
some damage and must be
evacuated.  More importantly, the
experimental testbed (the [Vorknkx])
must be moved to a new secret
location.  The cloaking device must
not be allowed to fall into Zaarin's
hands!
   A Muurian Transport and a
handful of Escort Transports will
arrive any moment to begin the
evacuation.  The Corellian Corvette
[Vorknkx] will enter hyperspace as
soon as Muurian Transport
[Shadow's] technicians can enable
the corvette's hyperdrive.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly [Missile Boat Mu 1]
(MIS Mu 1).  In additon to the
standard load of [40 advanced
concussion missiles] your craft will
also have [20 heavy rockets] to
take out the enemy Assault
Transports and Cruisers.  Also,
your craft remains fitted with the
[tractor beam].
   The two mine arrays protecting
the [Vorknkx] will slow the enemy
attack down, but not stop it.
Further reinforcements will not
arrive before the issue is decided.
Success of the rescue is in your
hands.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   Three Carrack class Cruisers
and four Assault Transports are
closing on our position.  The
Assault Transports are the more
immediate threat as they will likely
be employed to clear the mines.
Once the minefield is cleared they
could move in to capture Corvette
[Vorknkx].
   The Carrack Cruisers will
probably try to finish off the
platform while offering the Assault
Transports heavy fire support.
The traitors haven't committed any
starfighters to this attack yet,
but they could be holding them in
reserve.  Remain alert!
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   Continue as you have before.
Pursue your primary mission
objectives faithfully while taking
every opportunity to run a short
range scan on all major enemy
vessels.
// NEXT

// SKIP
What have we accomplished?
   We safely evacuated the
[Vorknkx] project in the face of
yet another furious attack by
former Admiral Zaarin.  The cloaking
device is nearly ready and only
needs a safe place for
development work to be finished.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Take out the Assault
Transports first with a single
rocket for each.  Then switch to
dual missiles to take out the TIE
Defenders while they're still busy
with the minefield.  Finally, help the
Escort Transports finish off the
Carrack Cruisers.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What have I accomplished?
   You were able to get short
range sensor scans on Zaarin's
Carrack Cruisers and Assault
Transports.  The data may not be
all that useful, but our intelligence
experts will analyze it very
thoroughly anyway.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   As you make your attacks on
the Assault Transports, hold your
fire until you're close enough for
a short range sensor scan.  Once
the Assault Transports have been
eliminated, engage the SLAMs and
make a quick inspection pass on
the Cruisers.  ÿ
