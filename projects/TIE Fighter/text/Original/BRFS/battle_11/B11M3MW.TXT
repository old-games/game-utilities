// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   Following the loss of ISD
[Courageous] due to Captain
Kuuztin's reckless attack, Grand
Admiral Thrawn has planned a
deception to lure Zaarin into a
trap.  Taking advantage of Zaarin's
weakness for technological
solutions, the Missile Boat is to be
used as bait.  We'll see how much
Zaarin enjoys being ambushed!
   It has been "leaked" that a
small convoy carrying new missile
boats is being sent into an area
near Zaarin's suspected
whereabouts.  The container
transports are in fact carrying
only munitions.  Your craft will be
the only missile boat in the area.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly [Missile Boat Mu 1]
(MIS Mu 1) out of Container
Transport [Neelie 1].  The CTRN's
tractor beam is being used to hold
your craft in place next to its
hull.
   As soon as your systems come
on line you should go to full
throttle so you can clear its
superstructure before it turns
away from the enemy craft.
   The standard load of [40
advanced concussion missiles] has
been augmented with a second set
of [40 advanced concussion missiles]
for a total of [80] warheads!  Also,
your craft has been refitted with
the [tractor beam].
   As soon as Zaarin has
committed himself, Thrawn will arrive
aboard his flagship, the Imperial
class Star Destroyer [Grey Wolf].
Three Strike Cruisers will accompany
the Grey Wolf and together we will
wipe out Zaarin once and for all.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   The lead element of Zaarin's
attack has already entered the
area about [6] kilometers away.  It
is a three ship group of TIE
Advanced.  Their role will probably
be to attack any fighter escorts.
That will be you!
   Intercept the enemy TIE
Advanced as quickly as you can
then prepare to engage the main
attack force when it drops out of
hyperspace.  We're not taking any
prisoners, so show no mercy.
Destroy the traitors!

How may I serve the Emperor?
   As always, use your short
range sensors whenever possible
to determine the contents of all
enemy starships.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What have we accomplished?
   You destroyed a great number
of enemy craft while protecting
the convoy long enough for it to
reach safety.  This has hurt
Zaarin badly, but unfortunately
not badly enough.
   The forces we bagged in our
trap were by no means the enemy's
main strength.  It is possible
Zaarin saw through the deception
and deliberately committed only
minor forces.  Or possibly this was
the best he could come up with on
short notice.  It is significant
that no attempt at capture was
made.
   In either case, our problem
remains.  Thrawn has decided to
try again with another convoy.
This time the bait will be even more
tempting!
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Save the CTRNs at F5 and F6
so you can quickly check their
status throughout the mission.
Then take out T/A Z-Alpha using
dual missiles as quickly as you can.
   Switch to single missiles and
start clearing the bombers.  Use
the 'A' key after targeting one of
the CTRNs to quickly find the
nearest threat.  As soon as
you've launched a missile, bring up
the other CTRN and then target
its nearest attacker.
   Continue alternating between
the CTRNs and killing bombers until
the convoy is safely away.  It is
absolutely critical that you keep
an eye on the sensors so you can
see any warhead launches by the
bombers.
   Whatever else you're doing can
wait, you must stop any warhead
attacks on the CTRNs.  Four
torpedo hits will destroy a
container transport.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What have I accomplished?
   We are uncertain at this time.
The intelligence data you obtained
is ambiguous and will need further
analysis.  The important thing is
you made the effort, and
sometimes that is the best that
can be asked for!
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   As soon as your convoy has
entered hyperspace engage your
SLAMs and head for the nearest
corvette.  Make a high speed pass
through the entire formation as
quickly as you can.
   Launch pairs of missiles as
often as you can, but be careful
your warheads aren't intercepted
by gunfire coming from the
corvettes.  You can kill a modified
corvette with as few as [11]
advanced concussion missiles.  Good
luck!  ÿ
