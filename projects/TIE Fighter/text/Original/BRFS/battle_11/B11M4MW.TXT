An Interdictor cruiser has pinned our strike force just as we were preparing our final trap for Zaarin!

A mixed heavy attack squadron of TIE Defenders and TIE Advanced is closing rapidly on our position.

Interdictor cruiser [Whirlwind] is their probable target. If it is lost, Thrawn's plan will fall apart.

Strike cruisers [Triumph, Iron Duke, G'neeznow, ]and[ Indomitable] cannot protect [Whirlwind] well enough.
// NEXT
Missile Boat [Mu 1] will join TIE Interceptor squadrons [Alpha] and [Gamma] to defeat the enemy fighters.
// NEXT
Immediately after the threat to INT [Whirlwind] is eliminated, all forces will attack INT [Maelstrom].

Speed is critical. Thrawn is expecting our jump into hyperspace in exactly five minutes!  Get to it!

// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   Our last trap failed to snare
Zaarin.  The relatively small strike
force he used has raised Thrawn's
suspicions.  We may yet find more
traitors among us who continue to
spy for Zaarin.
   Grand Admiral Thrawn has
decided to use more tempting bait
to lure the traitor.  This time a
convoy transporting an entire
squadron worth of new Missile
Boats will be risked.  Unfortunately,
the plan is already at risk as we
have just had an enemy force
enter our area!
   Your highest priority is to
safeguard our Interdictor.  To
ensure that our strike force joins
the rest of Admiral Thrawn's on
time, the enemy Interdictor must
also be destroyed as quickly as
possible.  We're not interested in
prisoners now, we need to finish
this quickly!
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly [Missile Boat Mu 1]
(MIS Mu 1) out of Interdictor
cruiser [Whirlwind].  In addition to
the standard load of [40 advanced
concussion missiles] you are being
given [10 heavy concussion bombs]
to take out the enemy Interdictor.
Also, your craft remains fitted
with the [tractor beam].
   Our task force consists of the
Interdictor cruiser [Whirlwind] and its
four escorting Strike cruisers.
The [Triumph] and the [Indomitable]
each carry a squadron of TIE
Interceptors.  The [Iron Duke] and
the [G'neezgnow] each carry a few
TIE Bombers.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   Zaarin's Interdictor cruiser
[Maelstrom] is keeping our task
force pinned to prevent our
coordination with the rest of
Admiral Thrawn's fleet.  Eight TIE
Defenders and six TIE Advanced
are closing on our position.

How may I serve the Emperor?

What have we accomplished?
   We destroyed all of the
attacking enemy forces and
prevented the loss of Interdictor
cruiser [Whirlwind].  As should be
clear now, the Interdictor class
vessels are of absolutely critical
importance.  We can't afford to
lose them...and neither can Zaarin!
   Despite your brave fighting,
the enemy plan was partially
successful.  Thrawn's plan required
precise timing to work and we are
now hopelessly behind schedule.
Also, the battle damage to the
[Whirlwind] requires that it put in
for repairs at once.  Worse still,
we have just learned that Zaarin
is already attacking the rest of
the convoy!
   Your prowess in the Missile Boat
means that you now must now fly
to the rendezvous point with the
convoy and prevent its
destruction or capture by Zaarin!
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Destroy the TIE Defenders with
dual missiles as quickly as you can.
Try to stay close to the [Whirlwind]
and intercept enemy rockets
whenever you can.  A good energy
balance is to set the cannon and
tractor beams to maximum recharge
and redirect shield recharge to
the engines.
   Once the TIE Defenders are
finished, your next priority is the
destruction of the [Maelstrom], but
you should try to take out a few
TIE Advanced on the way.
   The enemy Interdictor can be
destroyed quickly in two passes.
On the first you'll be approaching
from the stern.  With dual missiles
selected, target the cruiser's
warhead launcher.  As you close
within 2 kilometers engage the
SLAMs and skim past the cruiser
as near as you can, then fire
just as you pass in front of its
nose.  Your missiles will still have a
lock on the warhead launcher and
will loop back to take it out.  Now
swing around to make your second
pass using heavy concussion bombs.
