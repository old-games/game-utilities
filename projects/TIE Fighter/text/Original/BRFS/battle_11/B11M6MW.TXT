Zaarin continues to attack secret Imperial research sites. The [Vorknkx Project] base is his next target.

A short time ago one of Zaarin's Frigates dropped out of hyperspace and began launching fighters.

Missile Boat [Mu 1] will hyperspace to the base's location at once and engage the traitor forces.

// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   Grand Admiral Thrawn's plan to
trap Zaarin was unsuccessful due
to the traitor's cowardly retreat.
More worrisome is the fact that
the convoy you fought so
heroically to protect has
disappeared!
   Now comes an alert from
another of the Emperor's secret
research sites.  One of the
traitor Zaarin's Modified Frigates
has dropped out of hyperspace
nearby and is already deploying
fighters for an attack.  The
security of this installation is
paramount!  Your Missile Boat is
the nearest hyperspace capable
craft that can get there in time
to make a difference.
   To strengthen the defenses
surrounding the [Vorknkx Project],
Thrawn is also sending a pair of
scout craft to deploy minefields
around the test craft.  By
keeping the enemy fighters at bay
you will be buying time for the
scout craft to complete their
mission.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly [Missile Boat Mu 1]
(MIS Mu 1).  In addition to the
standard load of [40 advanced
concussion missiles] your craft will
have [20 heavy rockets] to take
out the enemy frigate.  Also, your
craft remains fitted with the
[tractor beam].
   The research facility consists
of two Platforms and four
specialized Probes.  The
experimental testbed is the
Corellian Corvette [Vorknkx].  Several
Assault Gunboat squadrons have
been alerted and should arrive in
minutes.  Once again we are
depending on you to keep things
under control until reinforced!
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   The Modified Frigate [Z-Borus]
has a full complement of fighters
already deployed.  In the vanguard
is a flight group of six TIE
Interceptors.  Following them are
three pairs of TIE Bombers.  Each
of the TIE Bomber pairs is being
escorted by a trio of TIE
Fighters.
   There may be a handful of
other fighters being held in
reserve.  Note that the TIE
Interceptors and Bombers have
shields, but the Fighters don't!
// NEXT

// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   The [Vorknkx Project] was
charged with the development of a
practical cloaking device suitable
for small starships.  If the energy
consumption of current cloaking
technology could be greatly
reduced, even smaller craft such
as starfighters might one day be
cloakable!
   The likelihood of success was
considered low, but it was a gamble
that would prove most rewarding
should a breakthrough be achieved.
Due to the far reaching
consequences such a breakthrough
would engender, only the Emperor,
Zaarin and the project staff knew
anything of its existence.
   Now a report of sudden
progress seems to have drawn
Zaarin out again.  His presence at
this time raises significant
questions.  There must still be
traitors among us who continue to
spy for him!  This also explains how
Admiral Thrawn's plan to catch
Zaarin was thwarted.
   Remain vigilant!  Inspect the
enemy frigate before destroying it
so that our analysts will have
that much more data to work with.

What have we accomplished?
   We defeated the enemy attack
and inflicted heavy losses on the
traitor forces.  The research
facility took some damage, as did
the minelayers.  The Corvette
[Vorknkx] was unhurt and is now
protected by a minefield.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Take out T/I Gamma first using
dual missiles.  T/F Alpha 1-3 will
attack you next but can be
ignored as you go after T/F Alpha
4-9.  You have to be very quick
about this to keep them from
doing too much damage to SCT
Sentry.  Because the TIE Fighters
are unshielded, try not to use
missiles unless you feel you have
to.
   Don't worry about the Bombers
except as easy opportunities arise
until all threats to the minelayers
are first eliminated.  Then take
out T/B Z-Beta 1,2,5 and 6, then 3
and 4.  (The first four all gang up
on the same platform, so it is at
greater risk than the other.)
   When the TIE Advanced show
up, you will have to be quick to
intercept them all.  If you're a
genuine ace pilot, you'll be able
take out the frigate before
engaging your SLAMs and going
after the TIE Advanced.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What have I accomplished?
   You were able to get short
range sensor scans on the
[Z-Borus].  The data may not be all
that useful, but our intelligence
experts will analyze it very
thoroughly anyway.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Engage the SLAMs and head
toward M/FRG [Z-Borus] to inspect
it the moment you have cleared its
starfighters.  As the TIE Advanced
arrive quite some distance away
you have a few moments to do
this.  The friendly Assault
Gunboats will do a good job of
intercepting at least half of the
TIE Advanced, but any that slip
through must be stopped by you.
