// MISSION: 
>Missile Boat Combat #2: Anti-warhead Defense
// NEXT
This mission designed for Peregrine Software by$>David Wessman 1994c
// NEXT
In this mission you will use your missiles to defend a cargo vessel from a multiple warhead attack.
// NEXT
Container Transport [Silver Bull] is en route to a rendezvous point near a SpecWar Fabrication Facility.
// NEXT
The Rebels are attacking with nine armed transports arrayed in a crescent wave attack formation.
// NEXT
The lead craft, [Samol 1] is moments from its weapon release point so you must hurry.
// NEXT
A wave of Rebel starfighters armed with torpedoes will enter if the first attack is stopped.
// NEXT
Shuttle [Aluma] will deliver a V.I.P. to the [Silver Bull] while you engage the Rebels.  Protect that shuttle!
// NEXT
The final threat you will face is a combined attack by [traitor] Assault Transports and TIE Defenders.
// NEXT
Though you have a large number of warheads, use them carefully.  You'll need them all!
// NEXT
One last thing, a pair of TIE Fighters from the FAC can be summoned if you need some reinforcements.

// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   To defend an Imperial container
transport and manufacturing
facility using the dual warhead
capability of Cygnus' new Missile
Boat.  You will learn how to target
and intercept enemy warheads
using advanced concussion missiles.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly [Missile Boat Mu 1]
(MIS Mu 1).  For this mission your
craft is armed with a load of [30
advanced proton torpedoes] in
addition to the standard load of
[40 advanced concussion missiles].
   Should you require assistance,
you may summon a pair of TIE
Fighters from the manufacturing
facility.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   There are [nine Rebel
transports] in a staggered
crescent wave attack formation.
The first six are armed with [heavy
concussion bombs], and the last
three have [heavy rockets].  Note
that the bombs are hard to see,
but won't be moving much faster
than the craft which launches
them.  In any case, you won't have
any trouble picking them up on
your sensors or in the inflight map
('[W]' key in map mode.)
   After the first attack wave is
defeated a series of Rebel
starfighters will begin to arrive.
Beginning with [Y-wings] and
progressing through [X-wings] and
[B-wings], they will be making [torpedo]
attacks.  Near the end, a pair of
[A-wings] will come in to attempt a
missile attack on the VIP shuttle
docking with the container
transport.  Note that your
advanced missiles can still catch a
Rebel missile provided your speed is
high enough when you launch.
   Finally, as a bonus, you may try
to defeat an attack by traitor
[Assault Transports] and [TIE
Defenders].

What have I accomplished?
   You have demonstrated the
ability to use the Missile Boat's
dual warhead capability to defeat
a multiple warhead attack!
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Try to be sparing in your
warhead use.  It may seem like you
have plenty, but you'll need them
all.  Remember, it's better to end a
mission with some you didn't need,
than to have to end a mission
because you've run out!  There
are times when you can simply use
a laser cannon to detonate an
enemy warhead.
   Wait until you have a solid lock
(red targeting box) before
launching a missile to intercept a
bomb.  Heavy concussion bombs are
slow, but usually have some
sophisticated electronics for
confusing the seeker systems of
missiles.  Rockets and torpedoes
are easier to intercept and often
only require a few moments of
target acquisition (yellow targeting
box.)
   Whenever there is a momentary
lull in enemy warheads to intercept,
switch to torpedoes and take out
the nearest enemy craft.  ÿ
