// QUESTIONS: 
What are the mission objectives?
   During our attack on the
Mugaari/Rebel weapons area, the
Rebels launched a raid on Outpost
D-34.  It fell to the Rebels
despite a valiant fight.  The Rebel
terrorists are in the process of
looting the station for any arms
or equipment they can steal.  Our
objective for this mission is to
retake the Outpost, recovering as
much stolen material as we can.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will be flying a [TIE
Interceptor], designated [Alpha 1].
You will be the flight leader of a
three craft flight group.  Your
craft will be equipped with [12]
concussion missiles.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   Besides the usual Y-wings and
X-wings, our intelligence believes
that the Mugaari have sold the
Rebels a squadron of the new
Escort Shuttles that they stole
from Cygnus Spaceworks.  These
craft are a design modification of
the [Lambda Class] Tyderian shuttle
for use as military assault and
heavily armed escort vehicle.  What
makes them particularly deadly is
their rear mounted, flexible laser
turret.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   The Emperor is concerned by
the Rebels' capture of Outpost
D-34.  The most disturbing element
is that they seem to know exactly
how to time their attack, when
Imperial forces are engaged in
another sector.  Be alert for
clues and opportunities to inspect
or capture any Rebel craft leaving
the Outpost when we recapture it.

// SKIP
What did we accomplish?
   Despite a heavy and intense
battle, our forces prevailed in
recapturing Outpost D-34.  The
Rebellion's plan to loot and pillage
Imperial property has been
thwarted.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   Protect the Frigate Fogger
from Rebel attack.  Concentrate
on those craft firing torpedoes
at your command ship.  If they are
able to fire their warheads, try
shooting the torpedoes down with
laser fire or even with your
concussion missiles.  Give respect
to the rear mounted laser turrets
on the escort shuttles.

What did I accomplish?
   Excellent, you have helped us
locate the equipment the Rebels
looted from Outpost D-34.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   Inspect the container
transport and other transports
that are leaving the Outpost.  ÿ
