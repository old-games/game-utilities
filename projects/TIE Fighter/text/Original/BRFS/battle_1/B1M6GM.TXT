// MISSION: 
>The Aftermath of Hoth #6: Destroy the Lulsla
// NEXT
Our last attack rendered the Rebel Cruiser [Lulsla] vulnerable for a direct attack using torpedoes. 
// NEXT
The Rebel starfighter threat is low since the last battle, however some fighters may have survived.
// NEXT
Besides the Lulsla's turbo lasers, the many mines that surround her may be the biggest threat.
// NEXT
Transports [Sigma] and [Omega] have been chosen for  the honor of destroying the Rebel Cruiser.
// NEXT
Gunboat Groups [Tau] and [Nu] will provide close escort for the attacking transports.
// NEXT
// SKIP
The supply ships need to be destroyed to prevent the Cruiser from getting any reinforcements.
// NEXT
This mission was created by [David Maxwell]$for Peregrine Software. [3-27-94]

// QUESTIONS: 
What are the mission objectives?
   The Rebel Light Calamari Cruiser
Lulsla is the target of this
mission.  Two previous attacks have
weakened its defenses to the
critical point.  We are confident
that a joint Assault Gunboat and
Transport attack can finish it off.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will be flying the [Assault
Gunboat] designated [Tau 1].  You will
be the flight leader of a two
craft flight group.  Your craft will
be equipped with the standard [16]
concussion missiles.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   The Rebel cruiser probably has
a small number of starfighters
remaining to help in its defense.
The cruiser's main protection lies in
the minefield around it.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   The Imperial attack on the
Rebel Cruiser will certainly succeed.
Its impending destruction will
probably cause its commander and
crew to try to abandon ship.  Be
prepared to track down its
commander and disable his escaping
craft.  Any other fleeing ships
should be destroyed.

// SKIP
What did we accomplish?
   You helped to destroy the
Light Calamari Cruiser Lulsla.  This
is a major achievement in our fight
against the Rebellion in this
sector.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   Get your shields to full
strength and keep them there.
Once you get close to the
minefield surrounding the Cruiser
Lulsla, you'll need all the shield
protection you can muster.  You
can use your missiles to take out
many of the mines, use only one
missile on each mine.  Stay at a
distance so fewer mines can
target you at once.

What did I accomplish?
   You have helped capture the
commander of the Lulsla, excellent
work.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   Watch carefully for any craft
that are fleeing the Lulsla.  While
inspecting all craft, keep an eye
out for the Cruiser's commander.
Destroy all other fleeing craft.  ÿ
