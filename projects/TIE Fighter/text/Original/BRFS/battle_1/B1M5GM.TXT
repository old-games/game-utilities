// MISSION: 
>The Aftermath of Hoth #5: Attack Rebel Lt. Cruiser
// NEXT
Gunboat patrols have located a Rebel Cruiser taking on supplies in the Bruanii sector. 
// NEXT
We can assume the cruiser has a strong force of A-wing, X-wing and B-wing starfighters.
// NEXT
Our attack will proceed in waves. You will fly in the first wave made up of 3 flight groups of [Gunboats].
// NEXT
Your primary task is to destroy the starfighter defense that the cruiser will send into the battle.
// NEXT
The second wave will enter the battle in five minutes. They will escort transports carrying torpedoes.
// NEXT
Once the starfighter defense has been eliminated, assist the second wave in their attack.
// NEXT
The supply containers need to be destroyed to prevent the cruiser from getting resupplied.

// QUESTIONS: 
What are the mission objectives?
   The Rebel attack on Outpost
D-34 was launched from a Rebel
cruiser in the Bruanii Sector.  We
have located its exact position
and are launching an attack to
destroy it.  You will fly in the
first wave to clear away the
Cruiser's starfighter shield, paving
the way for the second wave of
Assault Gunboats.  These gunboats
will lead the direct assault on the
Cruiser.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will be flying an [Assault
Gunboat], designated [Tau 1].  You will
have one wingman in your flight
group.  Your craft will be equipped
with [16] concussion missiles.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   The Rebel Cruiser will send its
finest A-wings, B-wings, and
X-wings to defend itself.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   The Emperor wishes to
investigate possible complicity of
Imperial forces in the recent Rebel
successes.  Imperial war materiel is
showing up very frequently in Rebel
hands.  Inspect all the Rebel cargo
containers before they get
destroyed to see if they may be
carrying Imperial equipment.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What did we accomplish?
   You destroyed the Cruiser's
starfighter defense.  Good work,
this will allow our forces to
destroy the Cruiser.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   Dogfight outside the range of
the Cruiser's lasers.  Use your
missiles sparingly and against the
most difficult targets, the A-wings.
Before firing, make sure you have
a full missile lock (red gunsight).
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What did I accomplish?
   Just as the Emperor
suspected, Imperial probes were
found among the Rebel supplies.
They could only have come from an
Imperial source.  An Imperial traitor
is selling the most sophisticated of
Imperial hi-tech equipment to the
enemy.  This is treason.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   It appears that our own
forces are very eager to destroy
the cargo containers sitting near
the Cruiser Lulsla.  They must be
inspected.  Our forces may be
trying to cover something up.  ÿ
