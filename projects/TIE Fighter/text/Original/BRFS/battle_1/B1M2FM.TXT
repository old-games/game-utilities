// QUESTIONS: 
What are the mission objectives?
   After interrogating the Rebel
prisoners captured aboard the
Mugaari freighter, we are sure
that the Rebels plan to launch an
assault on this outpost.  You must
hold off the attacking forces until
help arrives from the Imperial Star
Destroyer Hammer.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will be flying the [TIE
Fighter], designated [Alpha 1].  You
will have two wingmen.  Your TIE
Fighter will be specially modified to
carry [2] concussion missile
launchers holding 2 missiles each.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   We expect the Mugaari and the
Rebels to be joining forces to
attack us.  It is likely that they
only have the more obsolete
starfighters, like the Z-95
Headhunter and the Y-wing, to use
in this assault.  However, they may
use more advanced fighters like
the X-wing, as well.

How may I serve the Emperor?
   I am a special envoy of the
Emperor.  In this time of crisis,
political intrigue, and open rebellion,
the Emperor requires special means
of communication with his loyal
forces.  In the battles ahead, I
will ensure that his wishes reach
those like yourself who have
pledged their fealty to him.  You
will have many opportunities to
serve the Emperor and will be
rewarded for your efforts.
   In the mission ahead, locate
the Rebel officers who are fleeing
from Hoth in a stolen Imperial
Shuttle.  We have forces standing
by who will attempt to disable and
capture this shuttle once you
have located it.

// SKIP
What did we accomplish?
   You have defeated an attack
by the Rebels and Mugaari.  You
have saved our outpost from
destruction and destroyed many of
the attacking enemy ships.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   Concentrate your defense on
destroying the attacking Y-wings
and X-wings.  These ships are
carrying proton torpedoes which
can cause the heaviest damage to
our installation.

// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What did I accomplish?
   The Rebel officers you have
located will prove useful to our
cause.  From them we will learn the
whereabouts of other Rebel
terrorists.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   During the battle watch your
sensors carefully for the
appearance of any enemy shuttles.
Inspect them to see if they have
Rebel officers on board.  Don't let
anyone on your side destroy craft
with these officers.  We want to
capture them alive.  ÿ
