// QUESTIONS: 
What are the mission objectives?
   We have traced the arms used
in the recent attack on [Outpost
D-34] to a Mugaari cargo loading
area in the Tungra Sector.  We
suspect that the Mugaari are
providing arms and other aid to
the Rebels.  Our attack on this
cargo area is timed to catch the
Mugaari and Rebels in their next
illicit weapons exchange.  Your
mission objective is to destroy all
cargo-carrying vessels at this
site.  Destroy everything, take no
prisoners.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will be flying a [TIE Bomber],
designated [Alpha 1].  You will have
two wingmen in your flight group.
Your craft will be equipped with an
extra heavy load of [12] proton
torpedoes for use in this assault.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   We expect this weapons site to
be heavily protected by
starfighters.  The Mugaari have
only the more antiquated fighters,
so we expect to see mainly Y-wings
defending the site.

What did we accomplish?
   The timing of our attack was
perfect, we attacked when both
parties to the weapons deal were
still in the area.  Our attack
completely destroyed all of the
Mugaari and Rebel craft.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   Your TIE Bomber is not designed
for heavy dogfighting so avoid
direct engagements with enemy
starfighters unless you are sure
you can get on their tail and stay
there until you have destroyed
them.  Also, a number of the enemy
freighters are armed with laser
batteries, so use your proton
torpedoes from long range only.  ÿ
