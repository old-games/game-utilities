// QUESTIONS: 
What are the mission objectives?
   You are to inspect all cargo
carrying vessels that pass
through this area.  To accomplish
this, target each freighter and
transport, then fly close enough
for your ship's sensors to
determine what cargo the vessel
has on board.  Check your
progress on the [Mission Goals]
screen, toggled by hitting 'G'.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly the [TIE Fighter],
designated [Alpha 1].  You will be the
only craft in your flight group.
Stay alert for radio messages as
the mission progresses.  Use your
[Message Log] (toggled by hitting 'L')
to review this communication.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   Freighter traffic has been
above normal in this area.  We
think this is related to the
retreat of Rebel forces in the
aftermath of our attack on their
base on Hoth.  Stay alert for
Rebels hidden amongst the
freighter convoys!

What was our main accomplishment?
   You have discovered a
freighter full of Rebels trying to
escape from their base on Hoth.
Excellent work.  As we expected,
fleeing Rebels are trying to sneak
through this sector.
// NEXT
What extra did we accomplish?
   We captured a freighter full of
Rebels trying to escape from the
planet Hoth.  Hoth, a nearby ice
planet, was the main base of the
Rebels.  The recent Imperial attack
on this base has driven their
forces into flight.  The
interrogation of these Rebel
prisoners should help us track
more of them down.
// NEXT
Any special instructions?
   Just inspect the freighters
and transports, avoid any
dogfighting.  During inspections,
slow your craft down and be extra
careful to avoid colliding with one
of the large freighters.  Your small
TIE Fighter can not survive this
type of collision.  ÿ
