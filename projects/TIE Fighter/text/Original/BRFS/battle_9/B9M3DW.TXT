// MISSION: 
>T/D Technology, Mission #3: Protect Evacuation
// NEXT
This mission designed for Peregrine Software by$>David Wessman  1994c
// NEXT
The T/D research facility can't be held much longer.  There are no other Imperialist forces nearby.
// NEXT
All that is available is an ordinary bulk freighter which will be used to evacuate the last prototypes.
// NEXT
[T/D Delta 1] and [E/S Red Knight] will cover the evacuation and escort [FRT Mharsup] to safety.
// NEXT
Do not fail!  This technology must be preserved for the greater glory of the Empire!
// NEXT
The last handful of personnel will leave aboard [SHU G'nabgib].  Among them is the lead research scientist.

// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   To evacuate the TIE Defender
R&D platform and get the remaining
prototypes to safety.  The bulk
freighter [Mharsup] is the nearest
available craft and will arrive
shortly.  The two surviving
prototypes will be loaded onto it.
   A couple of shuttles are being
sent also.  The few remaining key
personnel and copies of the most
critical data will be evacuated on
the shuttles.  You are to ensure
that these craft escape into
hyperspace before the next
attack of Zaarin's forces.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly a [TIE Defender]
designated [Delta 1].  You will have
no wingmen.  For this mission your
craft has been loaded with the
standard armament of [8 advanced
concussion missiles].
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   Interrogation of prisoners
indicates the next attack will be
to DESTROY the facility!  The
failure of the last attack leaves
him with little choice.  Zaarin is
determined to keep the Emperor
from holding the platform or
benefitting from the TIE Defender
technology.  Clearly, Zaarin believes
the TIE Defender offers him a
technological edge...provided he is
the only one who can take
advantage of it!
   Expect at least one Nebulon-B
frigate with a full complement of
TIE fighters (two squadrons.) The
actual fighters will probably be TIE
Advanced or modified versions of
older designs.

What did we accomplish?
   We successfully evacuated the
last prototypes aboard [FRT
Mharsup].  We were also able to
secure some key personnel from
the facility before its destruction.
Among them, surprisingly was the
chief scientist.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Keep the [Mharsup] and the
evacuation shuttles in memory
('[Shift-F5]' through '[F7]').
Frequently check to see who's
attacking them (eg., '[F5]' then '[A]')
and then take out the attacker.  ÿ
