// MISSION: 
>T/D Technology, Mission #5: Trapped by Pirates!
// NEXT
This mission designed for Peregrine Software by$>David Wessman  1994c
// NEXT
We have come out of hyperspace into the middle of a trap!  A large ion cannon minefield surrounds us.
// NEXT
The pirates have a [Lorinar] Strike Cruiser and several [R-41 Starchaser] fighters and troop transports.
// NEXT
GUN [Nu] and GUN [Tau] will arrive soon, but maybe not soon enough!  Protect the corvettes until then!
// NEXT
Right now you are our only hope.  You will pilot TIE Defender [Delta 1] against great odds!
// NEXT
[SHU G'nabgib] has already been disabled and boarded.  The personnel and data on board were captured.

// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   To break Modified Corvette
group [Hashim] out of an ion cannon
minefield and prevent their capture
by the [Rneekii Pirates].
Reinforcements have been called,
but if we don't do something
immediately these pirates will have
captured our ships and be gone by
the time help arrives.  The [TIE
Defender] prototypes must not fall
into enemy hands!
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly a [TIE Defender]
designated [Delta 1].  You will have
no wingmen.  For this mission your
craft has been loaded with the
standard armament of [8 advanced
concussion missiles].  You will also
have the [improved tractor beam].
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   The [Rneekii Pirates] have a
Lorinar strike cruiser, several small
troop transports and a number of
R-41 Starchasers.  The minefield is
made up of [Type B ion cannon
mines].
   The troop transports are
probably the biggest worry.  If
they can be eliminated, we can at
least avoid capture for now.

What did we accomplish?
   We stopped the [Rneekii Pirates]
from capturing any of the modified
corvettes containing TIE Defender
prototypes.  For now.  The
corvettes are still disabled and
the prototypes remain vulnerable
to capture.  Additional help is on
the way and will arrive soon.
   The most disturbing turn of
events is that the pirates did
capture some of the key
scientists and data from aboard
[SHU G'nabgib].  This presents a very
serious problem.  Though it may
take a long time to duplicate the
TIE Defender technology, it will be
done eventually.  A crash program
to develop a counter to the TIE
Defender will have to be started
immediately.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Go to the map and target each
of the enemy Transports and
proceed to take them out as
quickly as you can (a couple of
missiles for each.) Then take out
the R-41 Starchasers.  Finally,
clear the minefield.  ÿ
