// MISSION: 
>T/D Technology, Mission #6: Transfer Prototypes
// NEXT
This mission designed for Peregrine Software by$>David Wessman  1994c
// NEXT
The pirates' trap was defeated, but the TIE Defender prototypes remain vulnerable. 
// NEXT
Three [Mssan] cargo ferries have been commandeered for us.  Each will dock with one of the corvettes.
// NEXT
The first two (of three) of these vessels arrived approximately [24 klicks] away just a few minutes ago.
// NEXT
The immediate danger is the arrival moments ago of a [Rebel] strike force.  They are about [20 klicks] out.
// NEXT
The force consists of [4] X-wings, [2] B-wings and [2] A-wings.  They are only [17 kilometers] from the CARGs.
// NEXT
GUN [Nu] is our only protection right now, and would be overwhelmed against such a force.
// NEXT
The Rebels will more than likely split their force to attack both groups of ships at once.
// NEXT
GUN [Mu] has not arrived yet.  Therefore, you will fly TIE Defender [Delta 1] once more.
// NEXT
Only a [TIE Defender] is fast enough to intercept an attack on the cargo ferries.  Launch immediately!!!

// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   To protect the transfer of
the TIE Defender prototypes from
Modified Corvette group [Hashim] to
Cargo Ferry group [Mssan].  The
cargo ferries will then deliver the
prototypes to Admiral Thrawn,
whose orders are to safeguard
them.
   Cargo Ferries [Mssan 1] and [2]
have arrived without escort and
are completely vulnerable to a
torpedo attack.  [Mssan 3] will arrive
shortly, accompanied by Assault
Gunboat group [Mu].
   A tug has been dispatched to
repair Shuttle [G'nabgib] so it can
be used to ferry some personnel
from the corvettes to the cargo
ferries.
   You are to protect the docking
operations of Cargo Ferries [Mssan
1] and [2].  Once they are safely
away, you are to enter the hangar
(cargo bay) of [Mssan 3].
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly a [TIE Defender]
designated [Delta 1].  You will have
no wingmen.  For this mission your
craft has been loaded with a
standard armament of [8 advanced
concussion missiles].  As before,
your ship will also have the
[improved tractor beam].
   Remember, your missiles are
easily capable of intercepting
torpedoes, so make sure you do
so!
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   The Rebel strike force is made
up of [4 X-wings, 2 B-wings] and [2
A-wings].  They will probably split
their attack to hit all of our
ships as quickly as possible.
Assault Gunboat group [Nu] would
have no chance of intercepting an
attack on the Cargo Ferries, so
you will have to.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   Zaarin's forces may yet catch
us while we're vulnerable.  Be
prepared to respond immediately to
the first sign of the traitors.
Remember that depriving the
Emperor of the TIE Defender
technology is key to Zaarin's
overall strategy.  You must do
whatever is necessary to thwart
Zaarin.
   Know that your Emperor
watches over you.  Many are called
to serve the Emperor, but only
the most skillful warriors are
chosen for such dangerous
assignments.  Serve the Emperor
well and you will reap great
rewards!

What did we accomplish?
   We stopped a Rebel strike
force cold and prevented the
destruction of the cargo ferries.
Unfortunately, while we were killing
Rebels, another pirate group was
able to capture one of our
modified corvettes.  As it was still
carrying a prototype TIE Defender,
we can assume we will soon be
facing new threats.
   There was little that could
have been done given the
circumstances, but we'll be lucky to
survive the Emperor's scrutiny of
our performance.  There are going
to be some very serious
repercussions to the spread of
this technology.  Great efforts will
have to be made to stop this.
Your best hope is that skilled
pilots such as you will be needed
now more than ever.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Try to take out one or two
X-wings on your way to the
B-wings.  You can do this if you
hurry, using one missile per X-wing
followed up with a quad burst from
your lasers.
   Next, attack and kill the lead
B-wing (it will require three
missiles.) Use your last missiles on
the remaining B-wing.  If they've
launched any torpedoes you may
have to use some of your missiles
to intercept them.
   Don't even try to stop the
pirates.  There's no way to do it
and still protect the cargo ferries.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What did I accomplish?
   You destroyed more enemies of
the Emperor!  You are serving the
Emperor in the most glorious way
possible, in the fight of good
against evil!  Many are the evils
that threaten the galaxy.  Only
the Emperor and those who serve
him can protect the peace of the
Empire.  You have served well.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   When dogfighting TIE Defenders,
you will have good success if you
use the tractor beam.  Set your
cannon recharge rate at maximum.
Keep the shield and beam recharge
rates at normal.  When engaging a
target, redirect shield recharge
entirely to the engines and reset
the beam recharge to maximum.
   Engage the beam only when
your target is in front of you.
Remember to rebalance the shields
whenever you take a hit and keep
up a steady transfer of cannon
energy to the shields.  Use single
missiles or quad laser fire, and be
ready to select ion cannons as
soon as the target's shields go.
You can save valuable seconds by
disabling a craft first, then killing
it later when all other threats
have been neutralized.
   Let not your anger [blind] you.
Rather, let it [consume] you and in
the [purity] of your [hatred] you will
find the [deaths] of your enemies.
[Long live Emperor Palpatine!] ÿ
