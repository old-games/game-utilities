// NEXT
Each of the three modified corvettes will receive one TIE Defender.  You will fly [Delta 1] to [Hashim 3].
// NEXT
M/CRV [Hashim] will be escorted by GUN [Nu].  They will be responsible for covering the operation.

// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   To escort Freighter [Mharsup] to
a rendezvous with Modified
Corvette group [Hashim].  The [TIE
Defender] prototypes are
dangerously vulnerable aboard the
freighter.  The modified corvettes
are fast and reasonably well armed.
   Each of the prototypes
(including the one you'll be flying)
are to be loaded into a modified
corvette for delivery to Admiral
Thrawn.  The Emperor has directed
Thrawn to ensure that these
craft are taken to a secret
location where they will be safe.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly a [TIE Defender]
designated [Delta 1].  You will have
no wingmen.  For this mission your
craft has been loaded with the
standard armament of [8 advanced
concussion missiles].  In addition,
your ship is equipped with the
[improved tractor beam].
   Remember, the bulk freighter
has no armament and Shuttle
[G'nabgib] is not designed for heavy
combat.  If we encounter trouble,
you will be expected to take care
of it.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   No oppostion is expected, but
the rendezvous point was the site
of a recent Rebel attack.  The
Rebels don't usually hit the same
place twice in a row, but if they
do you can expect the usual
assortment of X-wings, Y-wings,
etc.

What did we accomplish?
   We got all three TIE Defender
prototypes safely aboard the
modified corvettes while fighting
off a Rebel attack!
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Take out the A-wings as quickly
as you can until the B-wings
arrive.  One missile, then a quad
laser burst will be sufficient.  You
should be able to kill all but one or
two before the B-wings come into
range.  Once the B-wings are in
range go after them, but keep an
eye out for the Rebels'
transports.  The transports are
key because without them they
can't capture the [Mharsup].  ÿ
