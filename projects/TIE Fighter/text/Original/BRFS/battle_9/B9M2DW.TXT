// COMPLETION MESSAGES:
Good work, Delta 1! Zaarin's forces were repulsed
Unfortunately, the Adarga is no longer able to protect the base
Excellent, Delta 1! One more TIE Defender for the Emperor!
And four less for Zaarin!
Well, Delta 1, pick a random course into hyperspace..
No use going home now, you'll only face execution for failure

In a mirror image of our last operation, Zaarin has sent his own T/Ds and ATRs to retake the platform.

ISD [Adarga] and its starfighters must be dealt with first, so we are their first target.

The attack must be stopped. Most importantly, the TIE Defender research platform must be held!

Take out the assault transports as quickly as you can before worrying too much about the T/Ds.

// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   To hold the TIE Defender R & D
platform against the
counterattack by Zaarin's forces.
The platform's shields are back on
line, but not at full power.  [ISD
Adarga] remains on station, but has
only two squadrons of TIE
fighters, one of Interceptors and
one of Bombers.
   It seems clear that Zaarin
believed the technology embodied in
the TIE Defender would give him
the edge he needed to take out
the Emperor.  He did not foresee
the extraordinary way in which you
would turn his deadly weapon
against him.  Your loyalty to the
Emperor and the skill you have
displayed in dispatching his enemies
has won you great honor!  Your
prowess in the TIE Defender will
make the difference here!
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly a [TIE Defender]
designated [Delta 1].  You will have
no wingmen.  For this mission your
craft has been loaded with the
standard armament of [8 advanced
concussion missiles].  Also, you will
have the [improved tractor beam].
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   The attack force is nine
[Assault Transports], though this is
probably only the first wave.  You
may expect them to be joined by
[TIE Defenders] to mirror the
operation you just participated in.
Zaarin has committed a larger
force, though, and it appears that
their first target will be the
[Adarga].  With the [Adarga]
neutralized, they can then turn
their attention to the platform.
This facility must be held!
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   The TIE Defenders are too
valuable to destroy unless
absolutely necessary.  Try to
disable them if you can, but worry
about the Assault Transports
first.  Any captured pilots will be
interrogated as to the rest of
Zaarin's plans!
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What did we accomplish?
   We stopped Zaarin's attempt to
recapture the TIE Defender R&D
platform, but at a terrific cost!
The station is now almost
defenseless against any further
attacks.  Therefore, evacuation will
begin immediately and any remaining
prototypes or relevant technology
will be removed to safety.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   You will need exceptional
gunnery skills to save the [Adarga].
Fly toward Assault Transport [Sigma]
and take out as many rockets as
you can.  After the first salvo,
the ATRs will close in to use their
cannons.  Use this time to eliminate
the TIE Defenders.  The quickest
way is to launch a pair of missiles
at each.  Next, go back to the
ATRs.  Try disabling them and then
letting the [Adarga's] fighters and
gunners finish them off.
   If the platform comes under
attack you only have to ensure
that it isn't captured.  Should its
defenses be disabled destroy
whichever ATR is attempting to
board.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What did I accomplish?
   You've added to the number of
TIE Defenders in loyal hands while
depriving the enemies of the Empire
of their use.  Also, interrogation
may be able to tell us something
of Zaarin's next move.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Ignore the TIE Defenders until
all of the Assault Transports are
destroyed.  When you're attacking
the TIE Defenders use a single
missile to take out the shields
quickly, then switch to ion cannons.
Be prepared to order any other
Imperial craft away if they attack
any of the disabled TIE Defenders.
