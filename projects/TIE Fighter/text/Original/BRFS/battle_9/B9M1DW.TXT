This mission designed for Peregrine Software by$>David Wessman  1994c
// NEXT
Zaarin's forces are stripping the research facility where the TIE Defender was developed.
// NEXT
They must be prevented from carrying out any sabotage or escaping with any critical technology.
// NEXT
T/D [Delta] will team with ATR [Omega] to thwart Zaarin's plans and regain Imperial control of the installation.
// NEXT
TIE Defender [Delta] will initiate the operation by eliminating any starfighter defenses.
// NEXT
As this phase nears completion, Assault Transport [Omega] will enter to destroy any cargo vessels.
// NEXT
The platform can then be disabled and ATR [Omega] will debark a Stormtrooper detachment to take control.

// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   To prevent Zaarin's forces from
stripping the research platform
where he led development of the
TIE Defender.  Zaarin is too smart
not to have contingency plans for
his failed coup attempt.  His only
hope may be in maintaining a slim
technological advantage over loyal
Imperial forces.
   If he can keep the Emperor
from further development or
deployment of the TIE Advanced or
the TIE Defender, he will surely
escape.  With the Imperial Navy
weakened in this way, the Rebels
will be given a respite from our
effort to wipe them out.  If the
Rebels are able to make a
comeback, Zaarin will take
advantage of the situation.
   The TIE Defender R&D platform
is to be captured and any cargo
craft entering the area are to be
destroyed.  Any opposition
encountered at the station is to
be swept aside.  The [ISD Adarga] is
en route and should arrive as the
operation is concluded.  Failure is
not an option!
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly a [TIE Defender]
designated [Delta 1].  You will lead
the three ships in your flight
group.  For this mission your craft
has been loaded with the standard
armament of [8 advanced
concussion missiles].  You will also
have the new, improved [tractor
beam].
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   The platform is well defended
by its own point defense systems
which include an advanced
defensive missile system.
Additionally, there should be at
least one full squadron of TIE
fighters or Assault Gunboats.  You
will be seriously outnumbered, but
will have a tremendous edge in
combat capability.  Use it!
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   The Emperor wants Zaarin and
his pack of traitors destroyed.
No one is to escape his wrath.  To
be sure that all of the traitors
are caught we will want to capture
as many prisoners as possible.  Any
personnel shuttles or transport
craft you encounter are to be
disabled.  The prisoners will be
interrogated and all of their
co-conspirators rooted out!
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What did we accomplish?
   We thwarted Zaarin's attempt
to escape with the TIE Defender
technology and we have established
loyalist control over the facility.
We must now protect it from any
further attacks or sabotage.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Order your wingman to attack
the nearest enemy that is
attacking you ('E' then '[Shift-A]'.)
As soon as you're able, target the
platform's [warhead launcher] and
take it out with [3] missiles.
Remember, you can engage from as
far as [6] kilometers away.
   Then clear the remaining TIE
Bombers.  If you have missiles left,
take out some of the platform's
laser guns and turrets.  The guns
require a single missile, the turrets
two or three.  Remember to remain
outside the platform's turbolaser
range ([1.5] kilometers.)
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What did I accomplish?
   You helped capture a large
number of prisoners for
interrogation.  Their
co-conspirators will be revealed
and brought to justice!
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Watch for the event messages
regarding transports and shuttles.
Be prepared to take out their
shields quickly with a single missile,
then switch to ion cannons.
   When attacking Escort Carrier
Jitte try to take out the gun
turrets first.  Your firing runs
should be along a path that has
you grazing the carrier's hull and
presenting the turret in profile.
Skillful evasive maneuvers will allow
you to remain close enough to the
carrier to draw its fire but avoid
damage.  This will help Assault
Transport Omega tremendously
since it will allow them to keep a
steady course while making rocket
attack runs.  ÿ
