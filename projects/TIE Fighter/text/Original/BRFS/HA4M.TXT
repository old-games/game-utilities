// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   Your primary task is to insure
that the [Freighter Rasvin] delivers
its cargo intact to our command
ship, the [Frigate Laantis].  Both
ships will probably come under
attack during this hyperdrive
delivery operation.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly the [TIE Advanced]
designated [Alpha 1].  You will be the
leader of a 3 craft flight group.
Your craft will be armed with [8]
advanced concussion missiles.  This
new version of the standard
concussion missile has a larger
warhead, greater speed and has
greater homing capability.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   The Rebels know that the
Frigate Laantis is vulnerable to
attack so that they will certainly
send as large an assault force as
they can muster.  Be ready to
face all the Rebel starfighters.

What have I accomplished?
   You have performed well.
Despite the heavy Rebel attack,
you have enabled the frigate and
freighter to make the hyperdrive
transfer.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   The frigate and the freighter
both come under heavy attack,
particularly the frigate.  Use
[Shift-F5] and [Shift-F6] to store
them as targets at the beginning
of the mission.  To see who you
should defend first, select the
frigate as the current target with
[F5], then hit ['A'].  This selects which
attacker is closest to launching
his attack on the frigate.  Now go
after this enemy craft.  ÿ
