// COMPLETION MESSAGES:

We can return to prepare for the final assault now
Harkov's presence on the platform seals his fate
Let's return quickly so the final assault can begin!
What are we going to do now?
Those treacherous pilots have bested us!

// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   The objective is to destroy as
many of Harkov's TIE Advanced
fighters as possible.  Fifty
percent will be sufficient to allow
the next phase of the attack to
proceed.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly a [TIE Advanced]
designated [Mu 2].  Your flight group
will consist of 4 craft.  For this
mission your craft has been loaded
with a special armament of [8]
advanced concussion missiles.
   Remember these missiles are
faster, pack more punch, and have
superior homing ability.
Nevertheless, you will still find it
very frustrating to try to acquire
a lock at close range on a fast
moving target like a TIE Advanced.
Instead, use them while you still
have some range to work with, (1
to 2.5 kilometers.)
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   [VSD Protector] has as many as
two squadrons of [TIE Advanced]
fighters.  You need not get within
range of the Rebel platform or
the Protector.  Let the traitors
come to you!
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   We expect more subterfuge
from Harkov.  We must establish his
exact location.  Inspect any Rebel
transport or shuttle that you
see.  Harkov may be on board.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What did we accomplish?
   By destroying so many of
Harkov's fighters, you have
prepared the way for a final
assault on the Protector and the
Rebel base.  The departure of the
Protector is assumed to be
temporary because Harkov was
observed entering the platform
during the battle.  It seems
unlikely that he would abandon his
command in such circumstances, but
then his defection seemed unlikely,
too!
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Use only one missile on each
enemy fighter, then finish it off
with cannons.  Keep an eye out
for wounded craft attempting to
return to their hangar and chase
them down.  While dogfighting, use
your full screen cockpit view ('.')
to gauge your deflection shooting.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What did I accomplish?
   Your inspection of the shuttle
delivering Harkov to the platform
has forced a change in our plans.
We were preparing an assault to
board and capture [VSD Protector].
Now our target will be the
platform.  This will be a somewhat
easier task, so be grateful.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Stay with your flight group for
the first encounter so you can
finish off any enemy survivors.
Keep checking the map to find
enemies as they get within missile
range.  This is your best
opportunity to kill them quickly.
   [Shuttle Toten] launches when
half the TIE Advanced are
destroyed.  Be ready to disengage
any fight you are in.  Redirect all
energy to the engines and make a
quick flyby.  ÿ
