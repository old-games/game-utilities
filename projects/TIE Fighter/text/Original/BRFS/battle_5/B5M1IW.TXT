// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   Your objective is to
demonstrate your superior flying
skill by clearing a minefield in an
unshielded craft.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly a [TIE Interceptor]
designated [Gamma 1].  Your two
wingmen will be along to observe
only.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   You will face a number of [Type
1 Mines].  These should not present
a pilot of your skill with any real
difficulty.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   Do as your commander orders,
but remain alert for the
unexpected.  This mission puts you
at unnecessary risk.  We believe
you may be in danger.  If so, do
not hesitate to call for
reinforcements.  We have made
special arrangements.

What did we accomplish?
   We now have incontrovertible
evidence of Admiral Harkov's crimes.
[Lord Vader] himself is coming to
deal with him personally.  Your
knowledge of operations aboard his
flagship will be very helpful in
determining where Harkov is likely
to go next.
   Harkov knows his crimes are
punishable by death, so he must
be planning to defect to the
Rebels.  The Rebel Alliance is his
only hope of avoiding our
retribution.  This debacle may yet
work to our advantage if he leads
us to the remnants of the Rebel
fleet!
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Send for reinforcements
immediately.  Redirect your cannon
energy to the engines at maximum
rate and fly towards the
containers.  As you close in, keep
jinking and weaving to avoid fire
from the mines.  Be prepared to
quickly cycle forward through the
target list when you get close
enough to inspect the first
container.
   While you're waiting for Shuttle
Lambda to appear, stay near [M/FRG
Osprey] and the protection of its
guns.  When Lambda is launched,
make your flyby to inspect it.  As
through most of this mission, you
will have to evade enemy fire
constantly.  ÿ
