Your reconnaissance mission hit the jackpot!  Admiral Harkov's flagship, [VSD Protector], has been located.

[GUN Mu] will be sent back immediately in order to interdict an emergency supply convoy now enroute.

Your [concussion missile] launchers have been replaced with [rocket] launchers for this mission.

The [TIE Advanced] which gave you such a hard time on your last mission will still be there so be careful!

You'll be hitting the convoy far enough out that the T/As won't be able to stop you in time to save it.

As soon as the convoy has been destroyed return to base to prepare for the next mission.

// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   The objective is to interdict a
supply convoy before it can reach
the safety of the Rebel platform
and Harkov's Star Destroyer.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly an [Assault Gunboat]
designated [Mu 2].  For this mission
your craft has been loaded with a
special heavy warhead armament of
[8] rockets.
   Remember that rockets have
poor tracking and homing ability.
They are best used against
stationary or very slowly moving
ships.  If the target ship is at all
evasive, the rocket may well miss.
In such cases, wait until you're at
pointblank range to fire.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   The convoy consists of a
variety of cargo ships, most of
them armed.  A small starfighter
escort is likely.  This operation will
take place well away from the Rebel
base platform and [VSD Protector].
As many as two squadrons of the
new [TIE Advanced] are with the
Protector.  They will come to the
aid of the convoy very quickly, so
make your attack as fast as you
can!
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   Inspect the ships of the Rebel
convoy.  They are carrying supplies
destined for Harkov's forces.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What did we accomplish?
   By destroying the convoy, we
have weakened Harkov's task force.
Their ability to conduct even
limited operations has been
severely curtailed.  This success
will again be followed up by another
quick strike.  The next operation
will attempt to eliminate Harkov's
TIE Advanced squadrons.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Use only one rocket on each
ship, then finish off with cannons.
Focus on the cargo vessels and
don't get distracted by the
starfighters!  Work quickly!
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What did I accomplish?
   Your inspection flybys have
provided us with a pretty clear
picture of what sort of supplies
are most critical for Harkov.  This
will help us anticipate his next
move.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Order your wingmen to attack
an A-wing anytime a new arrival of
the convoy appears.  While your
wingmen are busy, you'll have time
to inspect the new ship.  Once
inspected, you can order your
wingmen to attack it and move on
to next ship.  ÿ
