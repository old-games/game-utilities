// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   The objective is to capture
[Admiral Harkov].  He was last
observed entering the Rebel
platform DS 5.  He is probably
waiting for the [Protector] to
return, but may attempt to
escape when he realizes our intent.
   It will be your responsibility to
disable any craft leaving the
platform.  The platform and all
disabled craft will be captured.
When Lord Vader arrives, Admiral
Harkov will be brought to him.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly an [Assault Gunboat]
designated [Mu 2].  Your flight group
will consist of four craft.  For
this mission your craft has been
loaded with the standard armament
of [16] concussion missiles.
   Your strike team will also include
a flight group of TIE Advanced to
deal with enemy fighters.  Three
minutes into the attack you will be
joined by Assault Transport group
Omega.  ATR Omega will have heavy
rockets to take down the
platform's shields quickly.  Be
prepared to lend assistance if
necessary.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   The starfighter defenses were
substantially reduced during your
last mission, but reinforcements
may have arrived since then.  If
so, your first task will be to work
with TIE Advanced group Alpha to
eliminate them.
   After that is the Rebel
platform itself.  It is well armed
and a minefield was observed being
laid.  The mines are the new Type
3.  These have the nasty habit of
launching a missile at the craft
that destroys them.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   You must insure that Admiral
Harkov is captured.  As you disable
craft fleeing from the Rebel
platform, be sure to inspect them
as well.  He must be apprehended!
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What did we accomplish?
   All of our primary mission
objectives were met.  Admiral
Harkov will be interrogated by Lord
Vader.  The location of [VSD
Protector] and the rest of
Harkov's band of defectors will be
discovered.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Do as your flight leader
suggests and split off to destroy
the minefield.  Start with the set
below the platform.  Use your
missiles so you can start as far
out as possible.
   The ships on the platform will
start leaving about two minutes
into the mission (sooner if
attacked.) The Corellian transport
is the fastest so be sure check
its status as often as you can.
As soon as it takes off, get on
its tail.  You may find it necessary
to redirect all available energy to
the engines so you'll have
sufficient speed to overtake it.
Disable it as quickly as you can
and then go after Shuttle Toten,
and finally Transport Kolermigon.
   After that, take available
targets as you find them.
// NEXT

What did I accomplish?
   You inspected all of the craft
leaving the platform, thereby
discovering which one Harkov was
on.  Also, you were instrumental in
the capture of the platform.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Take the time to inspect the
craft you are disabling.  This
should be done at same time you
disable them.
   To help the ATRs you can
intercept any enemy craft that
interfere with them, or simply lend
your firepower to their attack on
the platform.  Remember, the
platform's defenses are weaker for
its lower hemisphere.  ÿ
