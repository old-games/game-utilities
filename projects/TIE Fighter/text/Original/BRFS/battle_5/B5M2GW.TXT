// MISSION: 
>Battle for Honor, Mission #2: Assault Gunboat Recon
// NEXT
This mission designed for Peregrine Software, Inc. by >David Wessman  1994c
// NEXT
[Harkov] is now on the run.  His illegal arms deals and misappropriation of Navy funds have been revealed.
// NEXT
Worse, it is also evident [Harkov] intends to lead a mass defection of the units in his command!
// NEXT
The Emperor is sending Lord [Vader] to interrogate him before his execution as a traitor.
// NEXT
Our orders are to bring Harkov to Lord Vader!  Our first task will be to locate him and fix his position.
// NEXT
We have several possible locations for a Rebel supply station where Harkov may seek refuge.
// NEXT
[GUN Recon] will send flight groups of 4 ships to each of these locations in order to find Harkov.
// NEXT
Destroy any cargo containers at your target site as quickly as possible and return if Harkov shows up.
// NEXT
Avoid engaging Harkov's forces unless attacked!  You must report back so his capture can be planned.

// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   Your objective is to locate
[Admiral Harkov].  His task force
must now rely on the Rebels for
supplies.  All available Assault
Gunboats are being sent into this
sector for the task of tracking
down his defecting fleet.
   All Rebelbases and supply
caches which have been located by
this effort are to be attacked.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will fly a [Assault Gunboat]
designated [Mu 2].  Your flight group
consists of four craft.  For this
mission your craft has been loaded
with the standard warhead
armament of [16] concussion missiles.
Work closely with you wingmen as it
will be a "target rich" environment.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   Typically, the Rebels will have a
handful of starfighters providing
area defense for their supply
bases.  Since these are "rear
area" security units, they usually
consist of older fighters like the
Z-95 Headhunter.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
How may I serve the Emperor?
   Inspect all supply containers so
we can determine what items are
critical for Harkov's fleet.
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What did we accomplish?
   We located [Admiral Harkov] and
we destroyed the very supplies he
was trying to get!  We're going to
follow up immediately with a second
attack on the same base, so get
to the next briefing!
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Switch to missiles and select
dual fire mode.  Help your wingmen
take out the B-wings as quickly as
you can, then go after the
containers.  When attacking a
particular container, keep it
between you and the platform.
This way the platform's gunners
may help you destroy the
container in their eagerness to
get you!
// NEXT
// SKIP
// SKIP
// SKIP
What did I accomplish?
   You were able to inspect
enough of the containers at the
base to give us a rather good
estimate of what supplies may be
particularly critical for Harkov's
fleet.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   Be sure to disengage from the
dogfight early.  Inspect the
platform and containers while your
wingmen are occupied with the
enemy fighters.  When you have
finished inspecting, go back and
help your wingmen.  After the
enemy fighters have been
eliminated, you can make short work
of the containers.
   Don't waste time fighting
Harkov's TIE Advanceds when they
arrive.  As soon as your inspection
and destruction work is done,
hyperspace out of the combat
area!  ÿ
