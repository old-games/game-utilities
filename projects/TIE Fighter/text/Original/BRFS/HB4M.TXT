// QUESTIONS: 
What is the objective of this mission?
   Your objective is to destroy
the Rebel storage facility.  Your
primary targets are the
transports and containers.  Next,
the shuttles and starfighters
should be targeted.
// NEXT
What craft will I be flying?
   You will pilot a [TIE Bomber],
designated [Beta 1] of a three ship
flight group.  For this mission you
will be the flight leader.  Your
craft will be armed with a special
double load of [16] concussion
missiles.
// NEXT
What opposition will there be?
   Most of the Rebel craft are
just getting underway.  Expect
the stiffest resistance from the
Rebel shuttles who will fight
fiercely to protect their base.

What have I accomplished?
   You have destroyed the main
Rebel assets at their base.  Good
work, another strike against the
Rebellion.
// NEXT
Are there any special instructions?
   You should target the
transports first for they pose
the most immediate threat.  With
the help of your wingman, launch a
salvo of four missiles against each
one.  After the transports have
been dealt with, attack the
containers and the shuttles.  ÿ
