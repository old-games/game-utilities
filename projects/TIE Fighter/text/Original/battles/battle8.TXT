//BLOCK
The VSD Sceltor, a flagship _
of Admiral Thrawn's, is on alert
status because of Ex-Admiral
Zaarin and his followers.
Zaarin's forces are trying to
inflict mass damage on the Empire
by destroying the TIE Advanced
production capability.
//BLOCK
Another TIE Advanced _
factory is being ransacked of _
parts and equipment by Zaarin's _
forces. Zaarin's forces must not _
get away with anything. It is _
vitally important that Zaarin
does not get an advantage over
us in the area of starfighters.  _
//BLOCK
Throughout the Empire our _
war production capability has _
been severely crippled, _
especially in the area of _
TIE Advanced technology. There
is a need to get some factories _
back on line. Escort an Imperial _
supplies convoy as it arrives to _
resupply the TIE Advanced factory.
//BLOCK
The defense of the few _
remaining TIE Advanced factories
is one of the Emperor's top _
concerns. Thrawn has been put _
in charge of stopping Zaarin _
from inflicting any more damage _
upon home installations. But _
Zaarin's forces are not the only _
ones that wish to hurt the Empire.
//BLOCK
The Rebels have a new _
weapon. It's a mag pulse _
warhead. We need to get that _
technology from them. Attack _
and capture a Rebel Base.
//BLOCK
The Rebels have left us with
a tactical advantage by allowing _
us to capture this new weapon. _
Only Zaarin has arrived to _
relieve us of our prize. There is _
no possibility Thrawn will _
surrender. We must escape _
from Zaarin.
